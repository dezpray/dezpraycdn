Holy Father, inexhaustible fount of existence and love, <br /><br />
who show in living man the splendor of your glory, <br /><br />
and who deposit in his heart the seed of your call, <br /><br />
grant that no one, through our negligence, may ignore or lose this gift, <br /><br />
but that all may walk with great generosity <br /><br />
towards the realization of your Love.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lord Jesus, who during your pilgrimage on the roads of Palestine, <br /><br />
chose and called the apostles <br /><br />
and entrusted them with the task of preaching the Gospel, <br /><br />
of pasturing the faithful, of celebrating divine worship, <br /><br />
grant that, today too, your Church may not lack <br /><br />
holy priests who bring to all <br /><br />
the fruits of your death and resurrection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Holy Spirit, you who sanctify the Church <br /><br />
with the constant outpouring of your gifts, <br /><br />
place in the hearts of those called to consecrated life <br /><br />
an intimate and strong passion for the Kingdom, <br /><br />
so that with a generous and unconditional « yes » <br /><br />
they may place their existence at the service of the Gospel.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Most Holy Virgin, you who without hesitation <br /><br />
offered yourself to the Almighty <br /><br />
for the realization of His saving plan, <br /><br />
arouse confidence in the hearts of young people <br /><br />
so that there may always be zealous pastors, <br /><br />
who guide the Christian people on the path of life, <br /><br />
and consecrated souls capable of bearing witness <br /><br />
through chastity, poverty, and obedience, <br /><br />
to the liberating presence of your Risen Son. <br /><br />
Amen.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">32:23-32.</font>@@@@@That night, Jacob arose, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.<br /><br />
He sent them across the stream and sent over all that he had.<br /><br />
Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.<br /><br />
When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.<br /><br />
Then he said, « Let me go, for the day has broken. » But Jacob said, « I will not let you go unless you bless me. »<br /><br />
He said to him, « What is your name? » And he said, « Jacob. »<br /><br />
Then he said, « Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel (that is: God strives/struggles), because you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed. »<br /><br />
Then Jacob asked him, « Please tell me your name. » But he said, « Why do you ask my name? » And there he blessed him.<br /><br />
So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel (that is: Face of God), saying, « For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered. »<br /><br />
The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel, limping because of his hip.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">17(16):1.2-3ab.6-7.8.15.</font>@@@@@Hear a just cause, O Lord!<br /><br />
Attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer:<br /><br />
from lips free of deceit.<br /><br />
From your presence let my vindication come;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
let your eyes behold the right.<br /><br />
You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night,<br /><br />
you have tested me and found nothing.<br /><br />
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
incline your ear to me; hear my words.<br /><br />
Wondrously show your steadfast love,<br /><br />
O Savior of those who seek refuge<br /><br />
from their adversaries at your right hand.<br /><br />
Keep me as the apple of your eye;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
hide me in the shadow of your wings,<br /><br />
As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;<br /><br />
when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9:32-38.</font>@@@@@At that time, behold, a mute demoniac was brought to Jesus.<br /><br />
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, « Never was anything like this seen in Israel. »<br /><br />
But the Pharisees were saying, « He casts out demons by the prince of demons. »<br /><br />
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.<br /><br />
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.<br /><br />
Then he said to his disciples, « The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;<br /><br />
therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. »<br />
