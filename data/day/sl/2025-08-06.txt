Our Lord Jesus Christ took Peter, James, and John up the mountain to show them the glory of his divinity and to make known to them that he was the Redeemer of Israel, as he had shown through the prophets. He also wanted to prevent them from being scandalized at the sight of the freely consented sufferings he was about to endure for us in his human nature. Indeed, they knew him as a man, but they did not know that he was God; they knew him as the son of Mary, a man dwelling with them in the world, but on the mountain he made known to them that he was the Son of God, and God himself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They had seen him eat and drink, work and rest, doze and sleep, endure terror to the point of sweat drops, all things that hardly seemed in harmony with his divine nature and appeared to suit only his humanity. That is why he took them up the mountain, so that the Father would call him his Son and show them that he was truly his Son and that he was God. He took them up the mountain and showed them his Kingdom before manifesting his sufferings, his power before his death, his glory before the outrages, and his honor before the ignominy. Thus, when he would be seized and crucified, his apostles would know that it was not by weakness but by consent and of his own free will, for the salvation of the world.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">7:9-10, 13-14.</font>
At night, in a vision, I, Daniel, watched: thrones were set up, and an Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head, like pure wool; his throne was made of fiery flames, with wheels of burning fire.<br /><br />
A river of fire flowed, gushing forth before him. Thousands upon thousands served him, and myriads upon myriads stood before him. The court took its seat, and the books were opened.<br /><br />
I watched, in the night visions, and I saw coming, with the clouds of heaven, one like a Son of Man; he reached the Ancient of Days, and was brought forward before him.<br /><br />
And to him was given dominion, glory, and kingship; all peoples, nations, and people of every language served him. His dominion is an eternal dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingship, a kingship which shall not be destroyed.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">97(96):1-2, 4-5, 6, 9.</font>
The Lord is king! Let the earth exult! <br /><br />
Joy for the countless islands!<br /><br />
Darkness and cloud surround him, <br /><br />
justice and right are the foundation of his throne.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When his lightning flashes lit up the world, <br /><br />
the earth saw it and trembled.<br /><br />
Mountains melted like wax before the Lord, <br /><br />
before the Master of all the earth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The heavens proclaimed his justice, <br /><br />
and all peoples saw his glory.<br /><br />
You are, Lord, the Most High over all the earth: <br /><br />
you are exalted far above all gods.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9:28b-36.</font>
At that time, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and he went up the mountain to pray.<br /><br />
While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothing became dazzling white.<br /><br />
And behold, two men were talking with him: they were Moses and Elijah,<br /><br />
who appeared in glory. They spoke of his departure, which was about to be accomplished in Jerusalem.<br /><br />
Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but, staying awake, they saw the glory of Jesus, and the two men beside him.<br /><br />
As these last were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus: « Master, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. » He did not know what he was saying.<br /><br />
Peter had not finished speaking, when a cloud came and overshadowed them; they were seized with fear as they entered it.<br /><br />
And from the cloud, a voice was heard: « This is my Son, the Chosen One: listen to him! »<br /><br />
And while the voice was speaking, only Jesus was left, alone. The disciples kept silent and, in those days, they reported nothing of what they had seen to anyone.<br />
