<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of hell. On this day, "he shattered the bronze gates, he broke through the iron bars," as Isaiah says (45:2). Notice these expressions. It does not say that he "opened" the bronze gates, nor that he removed them, but that he "shattered" them, to make it clear that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this abode of captives. A prison where there are no longer doors or bars cannot hold prisoners anymore. These doors that Christ shattered, who could restore them? These bars that he broke, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of grace, they allow the prison gates and guards to remain, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act this way. By shattering the bronze gates, he testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why "bronze" gates?… Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew and was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham: "Drive out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him: "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for through Isaac will your offspring be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham got up early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar's shoulder, gave her the child, and then sent her away. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down a short distance away, about a bowshot. She said to herself: "I don't want to see the child die!" She sat down a short distance away. She raised her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar: "What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is, under the bush.<br /><br />
Get up! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, and he grew up and lived in the wilderness, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@The poor cry out; the Lord hears them:<br /><br />
 he delivers them from all their troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
those who fear him, to deliver them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, adore him: <br /><br />
those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they go hungry; <br /><br />
those who seek the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who among you loves life <br /><br />
and desires days to see prosperity?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so violent that no one could pass by that way.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out: "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding at some distance from them.<br /><br />
The demons begged Jesus: "If you expel us, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the entire herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the town to tell everything, and especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their territory.<br />
