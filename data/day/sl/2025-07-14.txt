<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Let Him Come to Me!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            [Saint Catherine heard God tell her&amp;nbsp;:] All of you have been called, in general and in particular by my Truth, my Son, when, in the anguish of desire, he cried in the temple&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Whoever thirsts let him come to me and drink&amp;nbsp;; I am the Source of living water&amp;nbsp;» (cf. Jn 7,37). He does not say&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Let him go to the Father and let him drink, he says&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Let him come to Me&amp;nbsp;».<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is that suffering cannot reach me, I the Father, but indeed my Son. And you too, while you are pilgrims and travelers in this mortal life, you cannot advance without finding pain, because sin makes the earth produce thorns, as I told you. That is why he said&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Let him come to me and let him drink.&amp;nbsp;» For by following his doctrine, whether by the observance of the commandments joined to the love of counsels, or by the real and simultaneous practice of precepts and counsels, that is to say by perfect charity or by common charity, whatever path you take, you can go to him, he will give you to drink and you will taste the fruit of the Blood by the union of the divine nature to the human nature.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            By finding yourselves in him, you will find yourselves in me, the Ocean of peace, since I am one and the same thing with him, as he is one and the same thing with me. Thus you are invited to the source of living water of grace.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3,13-20.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses had heard the voice of the Lord from the bush. He answered God : : « I will therefore go to find the sons of Israel, and I will tell them : “The God of your fathers has sent me to you.” They will ask me what his name is ; what will I answer them ? »<br /><br />
God said to Moses : « I am who I am. You will speak thus to the sons of Israel : “He who has sent me to you, it is : I-AM”. »<br /><br />
God said again to Moses : « You will speak thus to the sons of Israel : “He who has sent me to you, it is THE LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob”. This is my name forever, it is by him that you will remember me, from age to age. »<br /><br />
Go, gather the elders of Israel. You will tell them : “The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me. He told me : I have visited you and thus I have seen how you are treated in Egypt.<br /><br />
I have said : I will make you ascend from the misery that overwhelms you in Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, of the Hittite, of the Amorite, of the Perizzite, of the Hivite and of the Jebusite, the land flowing with milk and honey.”<br /><br />
They will listen to your voice ; then you will go, with the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will tell him : “The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has come to find us. And now, let us go into the desert, a three-day journey, to offer a sacrifice there to the Lord our God.”<br /><br />
Now, I know, I, that the king of Egypt will not let you go if he is not forced.<br /><br />
Also I will extend the hand, I will strike Egypt by all sorts of wonders that I will accomplish in its midst. After that, he will allow you to leave. »<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">105(104),1.5.8-9.24-25.26-27.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord, proclaim his name, <br /><br />
announce among the peoples his great deeds ;<br /><br />
remember the wonders he has done, <br /><br />
his prodigies, the judgments he pronounced.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He has always remembered his covenant, <br /><br />
word enacted for a thousand generations :<br /><br />
promise made to Abraham, <br /><br />
guaranteed by oath to Isaac.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
God makes his people numerous <br /><br />
and more powerful than all their adversaries ;<br /><br />
those, he makes them change their mind, <br /><br />
hate his people and deceive his servants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But he sends his servant, Moses, <br /><br />
with a man of his choice, Aaron,<br /><br />
to announce prodigious signs, <br /><br />
miracles in the land of Ham.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11,28-30.</font>@@@@@In that time, Jesus took the word and said : « Come to me, all of you who toil under the weight of the burden, and I, I will procure you rest.<br /><br />
Take upon yourselves my yoke, become my disciples, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your soul.<br /><br />
Yes, my yoke is easy to carry, and my burden, light. »<br />
