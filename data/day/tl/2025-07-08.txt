<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« He appointed twelve »</font>

<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            The Lord had begun by convoking the Twelve, through whom the future People of God was represented. In fidelity to the mandate received from the Lord, the Twelve, after his Ascension, progressively associated other persons with the functions entrusted to them, so that they might continue their ministry. (...) This is the way by which this ministry will continue, which, subsequently, beginning with the second generation, will be called the episcopal ministry, the ministry of bishops. (...) Thus, the succession of the episcopal function presents itself as the continuity of the apostolic ministry, a guarantee of perseverance in the apostolic Tradition.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            The link between the college of bishops and the original community of apostles is first understood from the perspective of historical continuity. As we have seen, to the Twelve were first associated Matthew, then Paul, then Barnabas, then others, until the formation of the ministry of the Bishop. (...) And in the continuity of the succession is found the guarantee of perseverance in the ecclesial community, of the apostolic college gathered around him by Christ. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            But this continuity is also understood in a spiritual sense, for apostolic succession in ministry is considered the privileged place of the action and transmission of the Holy Spirit. A clear echo of these convictions is found, for example, in the following text from Irenaeus of Lyon:&nbsp;«&nbsp;The tradition of the Apostles, manifest throughout the whole world, is shown in every Church to all who wish to see the truth, and we can enumerate the Bishops established by the Apostles in the Churches and their successors up to us. (The Apostles) indeed desired that those whom they left as their successors should be absolutely perfect and irreproachable in all things, by transmitting to them their teaching mission.&nbsp;».</font><br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">41:55-57, 42:5-7a, 17-24a.</font>

In those days, all the land of Egypt suffered from famine, and the people cried out loudly for bread to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you."<br /><br />
The famine spread over all the land. So Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, while the famine still grew worse in the land.<br /><br />
From everywhere people came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, for the famine was severe everywhere.<br /><br />
The sons of Israel, that is, of Jacob, among many other people, came therefore to buy grain, for the famine was severe in the land of Canaan.<br /><br />
It was Joseph who managed the selling of grain to all the people of the land, for he had full authority in the land. Upon arriving, Joseph's brothers bowed down before him, face to the ground.<br /><br />
As soon as he saw them, he recognized them, but he behaved like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them.<br /><br />
He kept them under guard for three days.<br /><br />
On the third day, he said to them, "Do what I tell you, and you will live, for I fear God.<br /><br />
If you are honest men, let one of you remain imprisoned in the guard post. The rest of you, go and take enough grain to relieve the famine of your households.<br /><br />
Then you shall bring your youngest brother to me: thus your words will be verified, and you will not die." They agreed,<br /><br />
and they said to one another, "Alas! We are truly guilty concerning our brother Joseph: we saw his distress when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us."<br /><br />
Reuben then spoke up, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not commit this sin against our young brother!' But you did not listen, and now we must answer for his blood."<br /><br />
As there was an interpreter, they did not realize that Joseph understood them.<br /><br />
Then Joseph withdrew to weep.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">33(32):2-3, 10-11, 18-19.</font>

Give thanks to the Lord on the lyre, <br /><br />
play to him on the ten-stringed harp.<br /><br />
Sing to him a new song, <br /><br />
play skillfully with a joyful shout.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord has thwarted the plans of the nations, <br /><br />
annulled the designs of the peoples.<br /><br />
The plan of the Lord stands forever, <br /><br />
the designs of his heart through all generations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
God watches over those who fear him, <br /><br />
who place their hope in his love,<br /><br />
to deliver them from death, <br /><br />
to keep them alive in times of famine.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10:1-7.</font>

At that time, Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal every disease and every infirmity.<br /><br />
These are the names of the twelve Apostles: first, Simon, called Peter; and Andrew his brother; James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br /><br />
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus;<br /><br />
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.<br /><br />
These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans.<br /><br />
"Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br /><br />
As you go, proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand."<br />
