<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Fear not… Be not afraid”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
I give You thanks, O Lord, <br /><br />
because I love You.<br /><br />
Most High, do not abandon me, <br /><br />
for You are my hope.<br /><br />
Graciously I have received Your grace, <br /><br />
it is what gives me life.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My persecutors will come, <br /><br />
and they will no longer see me.<br /><br />
A cloud of darkness will fall upon their eyes, <br /><br />
and an air of shadows will obscure them.<br /><br />
They will have no more light to see, <br /><br />
they will no longer be able to seize me. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
They have devised a plan, <br /><br />
and it has come to naught for them.<br /><br />
They have conceived wicked schemes <br /><br />
and behold, they are stripped bare.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the Lord is my hope, <br /><br />
I have no fear.<br /><br />
The Lord is my salvation, <br /><br />
I have no fear.<br /><br />
He is like a crown upon my head, <br /><br />
I will not falter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even if the whole universe were to falter, <br /><br />
I would remain standing.<br /><br />
If all that is visible perishes, <br /><br />
I will not die.<br /><br />
For the Lord is with me, <br /><br />
I am with Him.<br /><br />
Alleluia&nbsp;!<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">49:29-33; 50:15-26a.</font>@@@@@In those days, Jacob gave his sons this command: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<br /><br />
in the cave in the field of Machpelah, facing Mamre, in the land of Canaan, the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.<br /><br />
There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried; there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried; and there I buried Leah.<br /><br />
It was the field and the cave in it that were bought from the Hittites.”<br /><br />
When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.<br /><br />
When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrong we did to him?”<br /><br />
So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Before he died your father gave this instruction:<br /><br />
‘You are to say to Joseph: Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.’ Now please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when he spoke to them.<br /><br />
Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”<br /><br />
But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God?<br /><br />
As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.<br /><br />
So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.<br /><br />
So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s house. And he lived 110 years.<br /><br />
And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim of the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were counted as his own.<br /><br />
And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”<br /><br />
Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”<br /><br />
So Joseph died, being 110 years old.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">105(104):1-2, 3-4, 6-7.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord, call upon his name; <br /><br />
make known among the nations his deeds!<br /><br />
Sing to him, sing praises to him; <br /><br />
tell of all his wondrous works!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Glory in his holy name; <br /><br />
let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!<br /><br />
Seek the Lord and his strength;<br /><br />
seek his presence continually!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O offspring of Abraham, his servant, <br /><br />
children of Jacob, his chosen ones!<br /><br />
He is the Lord our God; <br /><br />
his judgments are in all the earth.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10:24-33.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his Apostles: “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.<br /><br />
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!<br /><br />
So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.<br /><br />
What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.<br /><br />
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<br /><br />
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.<br /><br />
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.<br /><br />
Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.<br /><br />
So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,<br /><br />
but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.”<br />
