<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Let him come to Me!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            [Saint Catherine heard God say to her&amp;nbsp;:] All of you have been called, generally and particularly by My Truth, My Son, when, in the anguish of desire, He cried out in the temple&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Whoever thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&amp;nbsp;; I am the Fountain of living water&amp;nbsp;” (cf. Jn 7:37). He did not say&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Let him go to the Father and drink,” He said&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Let him come to Me.&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            For suffering cannot reach Me, the Father, but indeed My Son. And you too, while you are pilgrims and sojourners in this mortal life, you cannot advance without encountering hardship, because sin makes the earth produce thorns, as I told you. This is why He said&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Let him come to Me and drink.&amp;nbsp;” For by following His doctrine, either by the observance of the commandments joined with the love of the counsels, or by the real and simultaneous practice of precepts and counsels, that is, by perfect charity or by common charity, whatever path you take, you can go to Him, He will give you to drink and you will taste the fruit of the Blood through the union of the divine nature with the human nature.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            By finding yourselves in Him, you will find yourselves in Me, the Ocean of peace, since I am one with Him, as He is one with Me. Thus you are invited to the living spring of grace.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3:13-20.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses had heard the voice of the Lord from the bush. He answered God: “I will go then to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ When they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I tell them?”<br /><br />
God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”<br /><br />
God also said to Moses, “Say this to the Israelites: ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.”<br /><br />
Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have surely visited you and seen what has been done to you in Egypt.<br /><br />
And I have said: I will bring you up out of your misery in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’<br /><br />
They will listen to your voice. Then you and the elders of Israel are to go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer a sacrifice to the LORD our God.’<br /><br />
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.<br /><br />
So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">105(104):1,5,8-9,24-25,26-27.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord, proclaim his name,<br /><br />
make known among the peoples his deeds;<br /><br />
remember the wonders he has done,<br /><br />
his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He remembers his covenant forever,<br /><br />
the word he commanded for a thousand generations:<br /><br />
the promise he made to Abraham,<br /><br />
the oath he swore to Isaac.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
God made his people very numerous,<br /><br />
more numerous than all their foes;<br /><br />
he turned their hearts to hate his people,<br /><br />
to deal craftily with his servants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then he sent his servant Moses,<br /><br />
and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br /><br />
They performed his miraculous signs among them,<br /><br />
and wonders in the land of Ham.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11:28-30.</font>@@@@@At that time Jesus said: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.<br /><br />
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.<br /><br />
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”<br />
