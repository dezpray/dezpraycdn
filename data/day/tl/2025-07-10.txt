<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Whoever wishes to preserve their life will lose it; whoever loses their life for my sake will preserve it »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      Let us reflect on this word of our Lord: that he wishes to « draw all things to himself » (Jn 12:32 Vulgate). He who wishes to draw all things first gathers them and then draws them. Thus does our Lord: he first calls man back from his outward wanderings and dispersions, making him gather his senses, his faculties, words, deeds, and within, his thoughts, his intention, his imagination, his desires, his inclinations, his understanding, his will, and his love. When all is thus well gathered, God draws man to himself, for you must first separate yourself from all external or internal good to which you have attached yourself, finding full satisfaction therein. This detachment is a painful cross, all the more painful as the attachment was firmer and stronger...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why has God allowed that rarely does a day and a night resemble the day and night that precede it? Why will what helped you in devotion today be of no help tomorrow? Why do you have a multitude of images and thoughts that lead to nothing? Dear child, accept this cross from God and bear it: it would become a very lovable cross for you, if you could surrender these trials to God, accept them from Him, with true abandonment, and thank God for them: « My soul exalts God in all things » (cf. Lk 1:46). Whether God takes or gives, the Son of Man must be lifted up on the cross... Dear child, leave all that, rather apply yourself to true abandonment..., and think more of accepting to bear the cross of temptation than of seeking the flower of spiritual sweetness... Our Lord said: « Whoever wishes to come after me must take up their cross and follow me » (Lk 9:23).<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">1:8-14, 22.</font>@@@@@In those days, a new king came to power in Egypt. He had not known Joseph.<br /><br />
He said to his people, « Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are now more numerous and more powerful than we.<br /><br />
Let us therefore take the necessary measures to prevent them from multiplying. For if there were a war, they would join our enemies, fight against us, and then leave the country. »<br /><br />
So they imposed taskmasters over the sons of Israel to oppress them with heavy labor. They had to build for Pharaoh the store-cities of Pithom and Raamses.<br /><br />
But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, which made them detested.<br /><br />
The Egyptians subjected the sons of Israel to harsh slavery<br /><br />
and made their lives unbearable by means of forced labor: preparation of clay and bricks and all kinds of field work; all these labors were for them a harsh slavery.<br /><br />
Pharaoh gave this command to all his people: « Every son born to the Hebrews, you shall cast into the Nile. Only the daughters shall you let live. »<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">124(123):1-3, 4-6, 7-8.</font>@@@@@Were it not for the Lord who was for us<br /><br />
- let Israel say it again -<br /><br />
were it not for the Lord who was for us <br /><br />
when men attacked us,<br /><br />
then they would have swallowed us alive, <br /><br />
in the fire of their anger.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then the flood would have swept over us, <br /><br />
the torrent would have overwhelmed us;<br /><br />
then we would have been overwhelmed <br /><br />
by the raging waters.<br /><br />
Blessed be the Lord <br /><br />
who has not made us prey for their teeth!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Like a bird, we have escaped <br /><br />
from the fowler's snare; <br /><br />
the snare is broken: <br /><br />
we have escaped.<br /><br />
Our help is in the name of the Lord <br /><br />
who made heaven and earth.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10:34-42; 11:1.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his Apostles: « Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth: I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.<br /><br />
Indeed, I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:<br /><br />
one's enemies will be the members of one's own household.<br /><br />
Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;<br /><br />
and whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.<br /><br />
Whoever finds his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.<br /><br />
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes Him who sent me.<br /><br />
Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.<br /><br />
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, truly I tell you, he will certainly not lose his reward. »<br /><br />
When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.<br />
