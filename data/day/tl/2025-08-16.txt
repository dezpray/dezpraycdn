<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God's Tenderness for the Little Ones</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            My daughters, God takes great pleasure in seeing the service you render to little children, just as He takes pleasure in their little cooing, and even in their little cries and their complaints. Each of these cries touches God's heart with tender compassion. And you, my dear sisters, when, at their cry, you relieve them, providing them with the services they need, for the love of God and to honor the childhood of Our Lord, do you not please God? And is God not honored by the cries and complaints of these little children? So take courage, my daughters! Love well the service of these little children, through whose mouths God receives perfect praise. It is not I who say this, my sisters; it is the prophet: "From the mouths of infants and nursing babes, You have ordained perfect praise." Oh my daughters, this is therefore true, since Holy Scripture affirms it.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            See how happy you are to serve these little creatures, who give perfect praise to God and in whom God's goodness takes such great pleasure, a pleasure somewhat like that of mothers, who have no greater consolation than to see the little actions of their little children. They admire everything and love everything. Thus God, who is their Father, takes great pleasure in all their little actions.<br />

Book of Joshua <font dir="ltr">24:14-29.</font>@@@@@In those days, Joshua had gathered all the tribes of Israel, and he said to them:<br /><br />
“Now, therefore, fear the Lord, and serve Him in sincerity and truth. Put away the gods your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.<br /><br />
“And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”<br /><br />
So the people answered and said: “Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods;<br /><br />
for the Lord our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who did these great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed.<br /><br />
And the Lord drove out before us all the peoples, including the Amorites who dwelt in the land. We also will serve the Lord, for He is our God.”<br /><br />
Then Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the Lord, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.<br /><br />
If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good.”<br /><br />
And the people said to Joshua, “Indeed, we will serve the Lord.”<br /><br />
So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”<br /><br />
Joshua resumed: “Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord God of Israel.”<br /><br />
And the people said to Joshua, “The Lord our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey.”<br /><br />
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.<br /><br />
Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.<br /><br />
He said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord which He spoke to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.”<br /><br />
So Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance.<br /><br />
Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">16(15):1-2a, 5, 7-8, 2b, 11.</font>@@@@@Preserve me, O God, for in You I put my trust.<br /><br />
I said to the Lord, “You are my God!”<br /><br />
O Lord, You are the portion of my inheritance and my cup;<br /><br />
You maintain my lot.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel;<br /><br />
My heart also instructs me in the night seasons.<br /><br />
I have set the Lord always before me;<br /><br />
Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I have no good besides You.<br /><br />
You will show me the path of life;<br /><br />
In Your presence is fullness of joy;<br /><br />
At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">19:13-15.</font>@@@@@Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.<br /><br />
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”<br /><br />
And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.<br />
