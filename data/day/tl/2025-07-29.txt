            "He who believes in me, even if he dies, will live; and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die." What does that mean? "He who believes in me, even if he dies like Lazarus, will live," because God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. Already concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the long-dead patriarchs, Jesus had given the same answer to the Jews: "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live for him" (Lk 20:38). Believe then, and even if you are dead, you will live! But if you do not believe, even if you are alive, you are truly dead. (…) From where does death come to the soul? From the absence of faith. From where does death come to the body? From the absence of the soul. The soul of your soul is faith.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
             "He who believes in me, even if he dies in his body, will have life in his soul, until the body itself rises again to die no more. And everyone who lives in the flesh and believes in me, although he must die for a time in his body, he will not die for eternity, because of the life of the Spirit and the immortality of the resurrection." <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            This is what Jesus means in his answer to Martha (…) "Do you believe this?" "Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world. Believing this, I have believed that you are the resurrection, I have believed that you are the life, I have believed that he who believes in you, even if he dies, will live; I have believed that he who is living and believes in you will not die for eternity."<br />

First Letter of Saint John <font dir="ltr">4:7-16.</font>@@@@@Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.<br /><br />
Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.<br /><br />
By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.<br /><br />
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br /><br />
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.<br /><br />
No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.<br /><br />
By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.<br /><br />
We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.<br /><br />
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.<br /><br />
We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11.</font>@@@@@I will bless the Lord at all times;<br /><br />
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br /><br />
My soul will make its boast in the Lord;<br /><br />
The humble will hear it and rejoice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O magnify the Lord with me,<br /><br />
And let us exalt His name together.<br /><br />
I sought the Lord, and He answered me,<br /><br />
And delivered me from all my fears.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They looked to Him and were radiant,<br /><br />
And their faces will never be ashamed.<br /><br />
This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him<br /><br />
And saved him out of all his troubles.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around<br /><br />
Those who fear Him, and rescues them.<br /><br />
O taste and see that the Lord is good!<br /><br />
How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Worship the Lord, you His saints;<br /><br />
For there is no want to those who fear Him.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry;<br /><br />
But they who seek the Lord will not be in want of any good thing.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">11:19-27.</font>@@@@@At that time, many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.<br /><br />
So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at home.<br /><br />
Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.<br /><br />
Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."<br /><br />
Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,<br /><br />
and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?"<br /><br />
She said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world."<br />
