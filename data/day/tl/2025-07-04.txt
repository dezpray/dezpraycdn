At Table with Jesus@@@@@<br />
            "As Jesus was at table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his disciples." (...) Let us try to understand more deeply the event recounted here. Matthew not only offered the Lord a material meal in his earthly dwelling, but, through his faith and love, he prepared for him an even greater feast in the house of his heart, as evidenced by he who said: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me" (Rev 3:20).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Yes, the Lord stands at the door and knocks when he makes our heart attentive to his will, either through the word of those who teach, or through an inner inspiration. We open our door to the call of his voice when we freely accept his inner or outer teachings, and when, having understood what we must do, we accomplish it. And he enters to eat, he with us and we with him, because he dwells in the hearts of his elect, by the grace of his love. Thus he unceasingly nourishes them with the light of his presence, so that they may progressively elevate their desires, and he himself is nourished by their zeal for heaven as by the most delicious of foods.<br />

Book of Genesis 23:1-4, 19; 24:1-8, 62-67.@@@@@Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years.<br /><br />
She died in Kiriath-Arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan. Abraham went there to mourn and to weep for her.<br /><br />
Then he left the body to speak with the Hittites who inhabited the land:<br /><br />
"I am but a stranger and a sojourner among you; grant me a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead."<br /><br />
Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.<br /><br />
Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and the Lord had blessed him in every way.<br /><br />
Abraham said to the oldest servant of his household, who had charge of all he owned:<br /><br />
"Swear to me by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell.<br /><br />
But you will go to my country, to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."<br /><br />
The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"<br /><br />
Abraham replied, "Be careful not to take my son back there!<br /><br />
The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.<br /><br />
If the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. But by no means are you to take my son back there."<br /><br />
One day, Isaac went out to the Beer-lahai-roi well. He was then dwelling in the Negev.<br /><br />
He had gone out to meditate in the field toward evening; and lifting up his eyes, he saw camels approaching.<br /><br />
Rebekah also lifted her eyes and saw Isaac, and she dismounted from her camel<br /><br />
and said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" The servant replied, "That is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.<br /><br />
The servant told Isaac all that he had done.<br /><br />
Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.<br />

Psalm 106 (105):1-2, 3-4ab, 4c-5.@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good! <br /><br />
For his mercy endures forever!<br /><br />
Who can tell the mighty deeds of the Lord, <br /><br />
or recount all his praise?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are those who observe justice, <br /><br />
who do righteousness at all times!<br /><br />
Remember me, O Lord,<br /><br />
in your favor toward your people.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Visit me with your salvation, <br /><br />
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones; <br /><br />
that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, <br /><br />
that I may glory with your inheritance.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 9:9-13.@@@@@At that time, Jesus went out from Capernaum and saw, as he passed by, a man named Matthew, sitting at his tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.<br /><br />
As Jesus was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and many sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.<br /><br />
And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"<br /><br />
But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.<br /><br />
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."<br />
