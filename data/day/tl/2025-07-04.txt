<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"The Bridegroom is with them"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The Church, mystery of the union of men with God: It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery as the purpose of God's design: "to unite all things in him" (Eph 1:10). Saint Paul calls the spousal union of Christ and the Church a "great mystery" (Eph 5:32). Because she is united to Christ as her Bridegroom, the Church herself in turn becomes a mystery (Eph 3:9ff). Contemplating the mystery within her, Saint Paul exclaims: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Col 1:27) (...) Mary precedes all of us in holiness, which is the mystery of the Church as "the Bride without stain or wrinkle" (Eph 5:27). That is why "the Marian dimension of the Church precedes its Petrine dimension" (...)<br /><br />
 <br /><br />
      The unity of Christ and the Church, of the head and members of his Body, also implies the distinction of the two in a personal relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of the bridegroom and the bride. The theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church was prepared by the prophets and announced by John the Baptist (Jn 3:29). The Lord himself referred to himself as "the Bridegroom" (Mk 2:19). The apostle Paul presents the Church and every faithful person, a member of his Body, as a bride "betrothed" to Christ the Lord, to be with him one Spirit. She is the spotless Bride of the spotless Lamb (Rev 22:17), whom Christ loved, for whom he gave himself "to sanctify her" (Eph 5:26), whom he associated with himself by an eternal covenant, and for whom he never ceases to care as for his own Body.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      "Behold the whole Christ, Head and Body, one formed of many (...) The Lord himself says in the Gospel: 'No longer two, but one flesh' (Mt 19:6). As you have seen, there are indeed two different persons, and yet they are one in conjugal union" (St. Augustine).<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">27:1-5, 15-29.</font>@@@@@When Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, he called his elder son Esau and said to him, "My son!" And he answered, "Here I am."<br /><br />
He said, "See, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.<br /><br />
Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me.<br /><br />
Prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die."<br /><br />
Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So Esau went to the field to hunt game for his father.<br /><br />
Rebekah took the best garments of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.<br /><br />
Then she covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the skins of the kids.<br /><br />
And she put the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.<br /><br />
So he went in to his father and said, "My father!"; and he said, "Here I am; who are you, my son?"<br /><br />
Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me."<br /><br />
But Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the Lord your God granted me success."<br /><br />
Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, so that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."<br /><br />
So Jacob drew near to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."<br /><br />
He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's; so he blessed him.<br /><br />
He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" Jacob answered, "I am."<br /><br />
Then he said, "Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.<br /><br />
Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."<br /><br />
So he came near and kissed him; and Isaac smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.<br /><br />
May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.<br /><br />
Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">135 (134):1-2, 3-4, 5-6.</font>@@@@@Praise the name of the Lord; <br /><br />
praise him, O servants of the Lord, <br /><br />
who stand in the house of the Lord, <br /><br />
in the courts of the house of our God.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Praise the Lord, for he is good; <br /><br />
sing praises to his name, for it is gracious. <br /><br />
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, <br /><br />
Israel as his own possession.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For I know that the Lord is great; <br /><br />
our Lord is above all gods. <br /><br />
Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, <br /><br />
in heaven and on earth, <br /><br />
in the seas and all deeps.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9:14-17.</font>@@@@@At that time, the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"<br /><br />
Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.<br /><br />
No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the patch pulls away from the cloak, and a worse tear is made.<br /><br />
Nor is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved."<br />
