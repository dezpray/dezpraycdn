Holy Father, inexhaustible source of existence and love, <br /><br />
who show in living man the splendor of your glory, <br /><br />
and who deposit in his heart the seed of your call, <br /><br />
grant that no one, through our negligence, may ignore or lose this gift, <br /><br />
but that all may walk with great generosity <br /><br />
towards the realization of your Love.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lord Jesus, who during your pilgrimage on the roads of Palestine, <br /><br />
chose and called the apostles <br /><br />
and entrusted them with the task of preaching the Gospel, <br /><br />
of feeding the faithful, of celebrating divine worship, <br /><br />
grant that, today too, your Church may not lack <br /><br />
holy priests who bring to all <br /><br />
the fruits of your death and resurrection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Holy Spirit, you who sanctify the Church <br /><br />
with the constant outpouring of your gifts, <br /><br />
put in the hearts of those called to consecrated life <br /><br />
an intimate and strong passion for the Kingdom, <br /><br />
so that with a generous and unconditional « yes » <br /><br />
they may put their existence at the service of the Gospel.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Most Holy Virgin, you who without hesitation <br /><br />
offered yourself to the Almighty <br /><br />
for the realization of his saving design, <br /><br />
arouse confidence in the hearts of the young <br /><br />
so that there may always be zealous pastors, <br /><br />
who guide the Christian people on the path of life, <br /><br />
and consecrated souls capable of bearing witness <br /><br />
through chastity, poverty, and obedience, <br /><br />
to the liberating presence of your risen Son. <br /><br />
Amen.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">32:23-32.</font>@@@@@That night Jacob arose, and took his two wives, his two servants, his eleven children, and crossed the ford of Jabbok.<br /><br />
He made them cross the stream, and also made all that belonged to him pass over.<br /><br />
Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the dawn.<br /><br />
When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he struck him in the hollow of his thigh, and Jacob’s hip was dislocated while he wrestled with him.<br /><br />
The man said, « Let me go, for the day is breaking. » But Jacob replied, « I will not let you go unless you bless me. »<br /><br />
The man asked him, « What is your name? » He replied, « Jacob. »<br /><br />
He said, « Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel (that is: God strives), because you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed. »<br /><br />
Then Jacob asked, « Please tell me your name. » But he replied, « Why do you ask my name? » And he blessed him there.<br /><br />
So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel (that is: Face of God), « for, » he said, « I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared. »<br /><br />
The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel, limping because of his hip.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">17(16):1,2-3ab,6-7,8,15.</font>@@@@@Lord, hear justice! <br /><br />
Hear my complaint, receive my prayer:<br /><br />
my lips do not lie.<br /><br />
From your face, judgment will come to me: <br /><br />
<br /><br />
your eyes will see where justice is.<br /><br />
You probe my heart, you visit me at night,<br /><br />
you test me, finding nothing.<br /><br />
I call to you, the God who answers: <br /><br />
<br /><br />
listen to me, hear what I say.<br /><br />
Show the wonders of your grace, <br /><br />
you who deliver from the aggressor <br /><br />
those who take refuge under your right hand.<br /><br />
Keep me as the apple of your eye; <br /><br />
<br /><br />
hide me in the shadow of your wings,<br /><br />
As for me, by your justice, I will see your face: <br /><br />
upon waking, I will be satisfied with your countenance.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9:32-38.</font>@@@@@At that time, behold, they presented to Jesus a demon-possessed man who was deaf and mute.<br /><br />
When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, « Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel! »<br /><br />
But the Pharisees said, « He casts out demons by the prince of demons. »<br /><br />
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.<br /><br />
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.<br /><br />
Then he said to his disciples, « The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.<br /><br />
Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. »<br />
