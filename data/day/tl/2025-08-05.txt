"Take courage! Do not be afraid!" (Mt 14:27)@@@@@<br />
            [Our Lord:] "My children, whatever happens to you, remember that I am always with you… remember that, visible or invisible, appearing to act or appearing to sleep and forget you, I am always watching, I am everywhere, and I am all-powerful. Never have any fear, any anxiety: I am here, I am watching, I love you – you no longer doubt, I hope, My love! – I am all-powerful… What more do you need?...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            All that happens to you happens by My permission or My will, by the permission or will of My love, so that you may derive great good from it, a great good that I Myself help you to derive through My grace… Therefore fear nothing, since nothing can happen to you without My permission… do not grieve about anything, at least not with a sorrow that goes beyond those instinctive, swift, and passing movements of sensibility, which are effects of nature and the senses; but conform your will to Mine…<br /><br />
<br /><br />
             Remember those storms that I calmed with a word, bringing such great calm in their wake… Remember how I supported Peter walking on the water… I am always as close to every person as I was then to you, and as ready to help him, to rescue him in everything that will be for the good of his soul. (…) Oh! in this life, the storm is continual, and your boat is always close to sinking… But I am here, and with Me it is unsinkable: mistrust everything, and especially yourselves, but have complete trust in Me, which banishes anxiety…"<br />

Book of Numbers 12:1-13.@@@@@In those days, because Moses had married an Ethiopian woman, his sister Miriam and his brother Aaron began to criticize him.<br /><br />
They said: "Does the Lord speak only through Moses? Does he not speak also through us?" The Lord heard.<br /><br />
– Now, Moses was very humble, the humblest man on earth.<br /><br />
Suddenly, the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: "Come out, all three of you, to the tent of meeting." They all three came out.<br /><br />
The Lord descended in the pillar of cloud and stopped at the entrance to the Tent. He called Aaron and Miriam; both came forward, and he said to them:<br /><br />
"Listen carefully to My words: When there is a prophet of the Lord among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak to him in a dream.<br /><br />
It is not so with My servant Moses, who is trustworthy throughout My entire house:<br /><br />
it is by word of mouth that I speak to him, in a clear vision and not in riddles; what he sees is the very form of the Lord. Why then did you dare to criticize My servant Moses?"<br /><br />
The Lord's anger blazed against them, then He departed.<br /><br />
The cloud moved away from the tent, and behold: Miriam was covered with leprosy, white as snow. Aaron turned to her, and behold, she was leprous.<br /><br />
He then said to Moses: "I beg you, my lord, do not let this sin that we were foolish enough to commit fall upon us.<br /><br />
May Miriam not be like a stillborn child whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb!"<br /><br />
Moses cried out to the Lord: "O God, I pray You, heal her!"<br />

Psalm 51(50):3-4, 5-6ab, 12-13.@@@@@Have mercy on me, O God, in Your love, <br /><br />
according to Your great compassion, wipe away my sin.<br /><br />
Wash me thoroughly from my guilt, <br /><br />
and cleanse me from my sin.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Yes, I know my sin, <br /><br />
my guilt is always before me.<br /><br />
Against You, You alone, I have sinned,<br /><br />
what is evil in Your eyes, I have done.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Create in me a clean heart, O God, <br /><br />
and renew and strengthen a right spirit within me.<br /><br />
Do not cast me away from Your presence, <br /><br />
and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 14:22-36.@@@@@Immediately after feeding the crowd in the desert, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.<br /><br />
When he had dismissed them, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.<br /><br />
The boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against them.<br /><br />
Toward the end of the night, Jesus came toward them, walking on the sea.<br /><br />
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.<br /><br />
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, "Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid."<br /><br />
Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."<br /><br />
He said, "Come!" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.<br /><br />
But when he noticed the strong wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"<br /><br />
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, caught him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"<br /><br />
When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.<br /><br />
And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."<br /><br />
When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.<br /><br />
When the people of that place recognized him, they sent word throughout the surrounding country and brought all the sick to him.<br /><br />
They begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed.<br />
