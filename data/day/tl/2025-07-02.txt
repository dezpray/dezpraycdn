<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of the Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day Jesus Christ entered victorious into the depths of hell. On this day “&amp;nbsp;he shattered the gates of bronze, he broke the bars of iron&amp;nbsp;,” as Isaiah says (45,2). Notice these expressions. He does not say that he “&amp;nbsp;opened&amp;nbsp;” the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he “&amp;nbsp;shattered&amp;nbsp;” them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this abode of captives. A prison where there are no longer either gates or locks cannot hold prisoners. These gates that Christ shattered, who could restore them&amp;nbsp;? These locks that he broke, what man could put them back&amp;nbsp;?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When earthly princes release detainees by sending letters of grace, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act in this way. By shattering the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why gates “&amp;nbsp;of bronze&amp;nbsp;”&amp;nbsp;?... Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21,5.8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now Sarah saw Ishmael, the son whom Abraham had had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham: “Drive out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac.”<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him: “Do not be distressed on account of the boy and your servant woman; listen to all that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring.”<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, he took bread and a skin of water, he placed them on Hagar’s shoulder, he gave her the child, then he sent her away. She left and wandered in the desert of Beer-sheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went to sit down a short distance away, about a bowshot. She said to herself: “I do not want to see the child die!” She sat down a short distance away. She raised her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the little boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called Hagar: “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the little boy, where he was under the bush.”<br /><br />
“Get up! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make of him a great nation.”<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar’s eyes, and she perceived a well. She went to fill the skin and made the boy drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, he grew up and lived in the desert, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33),7-8.10-11.12-13.</font>@@@@@A poor man cries; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
to deliver those who fear him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, adore him: <br /><br />
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry; <br /><br />
who seeks the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my sons, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who then loves life <br /><br />
and desires days when he will see happiness?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8,28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out from the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they began to cry out: “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?”<br /><br />
Now, there was at a distance a large herd of pigs feeding.<br /><br />
The demons implored Jesus: “If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”<br /><br />
He replied to them: “Go.” They came out and went into the pigs; and behold, from the top of the cliff, the whole herd rushed into the sea, and the pigs died in the waves.<br /><br />
The guardians took flight and went into the city to announce all of this, and in particular what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, the people implored him to leave their territory.<br />
