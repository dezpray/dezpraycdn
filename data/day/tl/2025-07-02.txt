<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of hell. On this day "He has broken the gates of bronze, He has cut through the bars of iron," as Isaiah (45:2) says. Notice these expressions. It does not say that He "opened" the gates of bronze, nor that He removed them, but that He "broke" them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could re-establish them? These bars that He broke, what man could replace them?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When earthly rulers release detainees by sending letters of pardon, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still return. Christ does not act in this way. By breaking the gates of bronze, He bears witness that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why "gates of bronze"?… Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to snatch His victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, "Drive out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, placed them on Hagar's shoulder, gave her the child, and then sent her away. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down not far off, about a bowshot away. She said to herself, "I do not want to watch the child die!" She sat down not far off. She raised her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar: "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy, under the bush where he was.<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, and he grew up and lived in the wilderness, and he became an expert archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@A poor person cries; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves him from all his distress.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
to deliver those who fear him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, worship him: <br /><br />
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry; <br /><br />
whoever seeks the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who then loves life <br /><br />
and desires days to see good?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so violent that no one could pass by that way.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now, there was a large herd of pigs feeding at a distance.<br /><br />
The demons begged Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their territory.<br />
