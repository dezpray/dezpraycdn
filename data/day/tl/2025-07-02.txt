<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the abyss of hell. On this day " he has broken the gates of bronze, he has snapped the bars of iron," as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. He does not say that He "opened" the gates of bronze, nor that He removed them, but that He "broke" them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could re-establish them? These bars that He snapped, what man could replace them?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release prisoners by sending letters of grace, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act in this manner. By breaking the gates of bronze, He testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why gates "of bronze"?... Because death was merciless, inflexible, hard as diamond. Never throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, never had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to snatch its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael, the son whom Abraham had had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, "Drive out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, he took bread and a skin of water, he put them on Hagar's shoulder, he gave her the child, then he sent her away. She departed and went astray in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down not far off, about a bowshot away. She said to herself, "I do not wish to see the child die!" She sat down not far off. She raised her voice and wept.<br /><
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called Hagar: "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy, under the bush where he was.<br /><br />
Rise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, he grew and lived in the wilderness, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-13.</font>@@@@@A poor man cries out; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 He saves him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
those who fear him, to deliver them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O fear the Lord, you his saints; <br /><br />
for those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The rich suffer want and hunger; <br /><br />
but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who among you desires life, <br /><br />
and craves many days to see good?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that way.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now, there was a large herd of pigs feeding at a distance.<br /><br />
The demons begged Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled, and went into the city and told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their territory.<br />
