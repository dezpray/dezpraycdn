<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of hell. On this day, “he broke the gates of bronze, he cut through bars of iron,” as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. He does not say that he “opened” the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he “broke them,” to make it understood that there is no longer any prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer any doors or bolts cannot hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could restore them? These bolts that he broke, what man could replace them?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When earthly rulers release detainees by sending letters of grace, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can re-enter. Christ does not act in this way. By breaking the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no more captivity, no more death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why “gates of bronze”?… Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew and was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant woman and her son, for the son of this servant woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac.”<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham on account of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant. Listen to all that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
And I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he is your offspring.”<br /><br />
So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes,<br /><br />
and went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child!” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.<br /><br />
Arise! Lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”<br /><br />
Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-13.</font>@@@@@This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him<br /><br />
 and saved him out of all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around<br /><br />
those who fear him, and delivers them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O fear the Lord, you his saints,<br /><br />
for those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry;<br /><br />
but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, O children, listen to me;<br /><br />
I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who is the man who desires life<br /><br />
and covets many days, that he may see prosperity?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, when Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so violent that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out, “What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”<br /><br />
Now a large herd of pigs was feeding at some distance from them.<br /><br />
And the demons begged him, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.”<br /><br />
And he said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled, and going into the city, they told everything, and what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their region.<br />
