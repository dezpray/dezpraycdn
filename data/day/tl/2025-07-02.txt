<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of Hades. On this day “&nbsp;he shattered the gates of bronze, he broke the bars of iron&nbsp;,” as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. He does not say that he “&nbsp;opened&nbsp;” the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he “&nbsp;shattered them&nbsp;,” to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this abode of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ shattered, who could restore them&nbsp;? These bars that he broke, what man could put them back&nbsp;?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of grace, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can return there. Christ does not act in this way. By shattering the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why gates “&nbsp;of bronze&nbsp;”&nbsp;?… Because death was pitiless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew and was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman and her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the slave woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar's shoulder, gave her the child, then sent her away. She departed and went to wander in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot. She said to herself, "I do not want to see the child die!" She sat down not far from there. She lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the little boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the little boy, where he is.<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, he grew up and lived in the wilderness, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34 (33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@A poor person cries out; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves them from all their anxieties.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
to deliver those who fear him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, worship him: <br /><br />
those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry; <br /><br />
who seeks the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who then loves life <br /><br />
and desires days when they will see happiness?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they began to cry out, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now at a distance from them, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.<br /><br />
The demons implored Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and the pigs drowned in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the city to report everything, and especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, the people implored him to depart from their territory.<br />
