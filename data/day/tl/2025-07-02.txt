<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of the Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ victoriously entered the abysses of hell. On this day, "he broke the gates of bronze, he shattered the bars of iron," as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. It does not say that he "opened" the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he "shattered" them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer doors or bars cannot hold prisoners. These gates that Christ shattered, who could restore them? These bars that he broke, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of pardon, they leave the prison doors and guards intact, to show those who leave that they, or others, can return. Christ does not act in this way. By shattering the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why "bronze" gates?â€¦ Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear away its victims.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew and was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now Sarah saw Ishmael, the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, playing.<br /><br />
And she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham on account of his son.<br /><br />
But God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the slave woman, because he is your offspring."<br /><br />
So Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down opposite him a good distance away, about the range of a bowshot; for she said, "I cannot bear to watch the child die." As she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.<br /><br />
Get up, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-13.</font>@@@@@This poor soul cried out, and the LORD heard;<br /><br />
 and saved him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the LORD encamps <br /><br />
around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O fear the LORD, you his holy ones,<br /><br />
for those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The young lions suffer want and hunger;<br /><br />
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, O children, listen to me;<br /><br />
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br /><br />
Which of you desires life,<br /><br />
and covets many days to enjoy good?<br />

The Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, when Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so violent that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now at a distance there was a large herd of pigs feeding.<br /><br />
And the demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the entire herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the city, and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the entire city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their territory.<br />
