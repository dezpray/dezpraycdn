<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of hell. On this day, “He broke the gates of bronze, He snapped the bars of iron,” as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. He does not say that He “opened” the gates of bronze, nor that He removed them, but that He “broke” them, to make it clear that there is no longer any prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars cannot hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could restore them? These bars that He snapped, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of pardon, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act in this way. By breaking the gates of bronze, He testifies that there is no longer any captivity, no longer any death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why gates of “bronze”?… Because death was pitiless, inflexible, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear away its victims.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now Sarah saw Ishmael, the son whom Abraham had had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, “Drive out this servant woman and her son, for the son of this servant woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham on account of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he is your offspring too.”<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, and put them on Hagar’s shoulder; he gave her the child, then sent her away. She departed and went astray in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down opposite him, at a distance of a bowshot. For she said, “I cannot bear to see the child die.” So she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy, where he is under the bush.<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make of him a great nation.”<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar’s eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him; he grew up and lived in the wilderness, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@The poor cry out; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves them from all their anxieties.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />those who fear him, to deliver them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O saints of the Lord, worship him:<br /><br />
those who fear him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry;<br /><br />
those who seek the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me,<br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who among you loves life<br /><br />
and desires days to see prosperity?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, when Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they began to cry out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”<br /><br />
Now at some distance from them, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.<br /><br />
The demons pleaded with Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything, and what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.<br />
