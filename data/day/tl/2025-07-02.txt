<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day Jesus Christ victoriously entered the depths of hell. On this day "he broke the gates of bronze, he shattered the bars of iron," as Isaiah (45:2) says. Notice these expressions. He does not say that he "opened" the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he "broke" them, to make it understood that there is no longer any prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could restore them? These bars that he shattered, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of grace, they leave the gates and guards of the prison intact, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act in this way. By breaking the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no longer any captivity, no longer any death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why "bronze" gates?… Because death was pitiless, inflexible, hard as diamond. Never throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to wrest its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, "Drive out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to whatever Sarah tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a waterskin, placed them on Hagar's shoulder, gave her the child, and then sent her away. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the waterskin was used up, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down a short distance away, about a bowshot. She said to herself, "I cannot bear to watch the child die!" So she sat a short distance away. She lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is, under the bush.<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the waterskin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, and he grew up and lived in the wilderness, and he became an expert archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@The poor cried, and the Lord heard:<br /><br />
 and saved him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br /> those who fear him, to deliver them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O holy ones of the Lord, adore him: <br /><br /> nothing is lacking to those who fear him.<br /><br />
The rich have suffered want and hunger; <br /><br /> but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br /> that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who is it that loves life <br /><br /> and desires length of days that he may see good?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so violent that no one could pass by that way.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now, there was a large herd of pigs feeding at a distance.<br /><br />
The demons begged Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the city and reported everything, and what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their region.<br />
