<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ victoriously entered the abyss of the netherworld. On this day, "he shattered the bronze gates, and cut through the iron bars," as Isaiah (45:2) says. Notice these expressions. He does not say that he "opened" the bronze gates, nor that he removed them, but that he "shattered" them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to say that Jesus annihilated this dwelling place of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ shattered, who could restore them? These bars that he cut through, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release detainees by sending letters of pardon, they leave the prison gates and guards in place, to show those who leave that they, or others, can still re-enter. Christ does not act in this way. By shattering the bronze gates, he bears witness that there is no more captivity, no more death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why "bronze" gates?… Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to tear its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael playing, that son Abraham had had by Hagar the Egyptian.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham, "Cast out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly distressed Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to all that Sarah tells you, for it is through Isaac that your offspring shall be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, placed them on Hagar's shoulder, gave her the child, and then sent her away. She left and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down a short distance away, about a bowshot. She said to herself, "I do not want to see the child die!" She sat down a short distance away. She lifted up her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy, where he is under the bush.<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make of him a great nation."<br /><br />
Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, he grew up and lived in the desert, and he became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-13.</font>@@@@@A poor man cries; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
those who fear him, to deliver them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, adore him: <br /><br />
nothing is lacking for those who fear him.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they are hungry; <br /><br />
but those who seek the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who then loves life <br /><br />
and desires days in which he will see happiness?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that road.<br /><br />
And behold, they began to cry out, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now, there was a large herd of pigs in the distance, feeding.<br /><br />
The demons begged Jesus, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them, "Go." They came out and went into the pigs; and behold, from the cliff, the whole herd rushed down into the sea, and the pigs died in the waters.<br /><br />
The herdsmen fled and went into the city to report all this, and especially what had happened to the demoniacs.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their territory.<br />
