<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"The kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
In search of your pearl<br /><br />
I have not set myself as the merchant&amp;nbsp;;<br /><br />
And I have not, in exchange for the Unexchangeable,<br /><br />
Given the love of the ephemeral.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I have not sold, according to the commandment,<br /><br />
The concupiscence of the earthly,<br /><br />
In order to acquire what is of high price&amp;nbsp;:<br /><br />
The morning star, born of the Dew.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O You who were born of the Virgin in the manner of the pearl,<br /><br />
God and man, the two forming but one,<br /><br />
Make it so that from your divine love<br /><br />
I am the beggar with a wounded heart&amp;nbsp;!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Open my nuptial chamber, I who sigh&amp;nbsp;;<br /><br />
Enter the apartment with the affection of the heart&amp;nbsp;;<br /><br />
Make your dwelling again mine<br /><br />
And embrace me with your right hand.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">99(98),5.6.7.9.</font>@@@@@Exalt the Lord our God,<br /><br />
prostrate yourselves at the foot of his throne,<br /><br />
for he is holy!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron the priest, Samuel, the Suppliant,<br /><br />
all of them, they implored the Lord,<br /><br />
and he answered them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the pillar of cloud, he spoke with them;<br /><br />
they kept his decrees,<br /><br />
the laws he gave them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exalt the Lord our God,<br /><br />
prostrate yourselves before his holy mountain,<br /><br />
for he is holy, the Lord our God.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,44-46.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds:<br /><br />
"The kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field; the man who discovered it hides it again. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.<br /><br />
Or again: The kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.<br /><br />
Having found a pearl of great value, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys the pearl."<br />
