<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« The kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
In Quest of Your Pearl<br /><br />
I have not acted as the merchant;<br /><br />
Nor have I, for the Inexchangeable,<br /><br />
Given the love of the ephemeral.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I have not sold, as commanded,<br /><br />
The concupiscence of the earthly,<br /><br />
To acquire that which is of high price:<br /><br />
The Morning Star, born of the Dew.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O Thou, born of the Virgin like a pearl,<br /><br />
God and man, the two forming one,<br /><br />
Grant that by Thy divine love<br /><br />
I be the beggar with a wounded heart!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Open my nuptial chamber, I who sigh;<br /><br />
Enter the chamber with affection of heart;<br /><br />
Make me again Thy dwelling place,<br /><br />
And embrace me with Thy right hand.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">99(98),5.6.7.9.</font>@@@@@Exalt the Lord our God, <br /><br />
Bow down at His footstool, <br /><br />
for He is holy!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron the priest, Samuel the Supplicant, <br /><br />
All of them called upon the Lord, <br /><br />
and He answered them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the pillar of cloud He spoke with them; <br /><br />
They kept His decrees, <br /><br />
The laws He gave them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exalt the Lord our God, <br /><br />
Bow down before His holy mountain, <br /><br />
for He is holy, the Lord our God.<br />
