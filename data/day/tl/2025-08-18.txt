« If you wish »

      This young man senses that while nothing is lacking in his virtue, he still lacks life. That is why he comes to ask for it from the only one who can grant it. He is sure to be in accord with the Law; yet he implores the Son of God. From one faith, he progresses to another. The moorings of the Law poorly guarded him against the swell; restless, he leaves this dangerous anchorage and comes to cast anchor in the Savior's harbour.

      Jesus does not reproach him for having failed any article of the Law, but begins to love him (Mk 10:21), moved by this diligence as a good student. However, he declares him still imperfect…: he is a good worker of the Law, but slothful regarding eternal life. This is already good, without a doubt; "the holy Law" is like a guardian (Rom 7:12; Gal 3:24) who instructs through fear and leads towards the sublime commandments of Jesus and towards his grace. "Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law for the righteousness of all who believe in him" (Rom 10:4). He is not a slave who creates slaves, but he bestows the status of sons, brothers, co-heirs, to all who accomplish the will of the Father (Rom 8:17; Mt 12:50)…

      This phrase "if you wish" admirably demonstrates the young man's freedom; it is solely up to him to choose, he is master of his decision. But it is God who gives, because he is the Lord. He gives to all those who desire and apply all their fervor and pray, so that salvation may be their own choice. An enemy of violence, God compels no one, but extends grace to those who seek it, offers it to those who ask for it, opens to those who knock (Mt 7:7).

@@@@@In those days, the children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served the Baals.

They abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed other gods from among the peoples around them. They bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord.

They abandoned the Lord to serve Baal and Ashtoreth.

Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. He delivered them into the hands of plunderers, abandoned them to the enemies who surrounded them, and they were unable to resist them.

In all their expeditions, the hand of the Lord was against them, for their misfortune, as He had told them, and as He had sworn to them. They were in great distress.

Then the Lord raised up judges to save them from the hand of the plunderers.

But they did not obey their judges either. They prostituted themselves by following other gods and bowing down to them. They were quick to turn aside from the path where their fathers had walked, obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not act like them.

When the Lord raised up a judge for them, the Lord was with the judge, and He saved them from the hand of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the Lord was moved to pity when they groaned under the violence of their oppressors.

But when the judge died, they would revert and sink deeper into corruption than their fathers: they followed other gods, served them and bowed down to them; they gave up nothing of their practices or their stubborn conduct.

Psalm 106 (105), 6.35.36-37.39-40.43ab.44.@@@@@With our fathers, we have sinned,

we have acted corruptly and wickedly.

they mingled with the nations,

and learned their ways.

Then they served their idols,

which became a snare to them:

they offered their sons and their daughters

in sacrifice to demons.

Such practices defile them;

they prostituted themselves by such deeds.

And the Lord's anger blazed out against His people:

His inheritance became detestable to Him.

Many times He delivered them,

but they were rebellious in their purpose,

and He looked upon their distress

when He heard their cry.
