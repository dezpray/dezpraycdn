<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">You have called the poor to surround You, my God!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            How divinely good You are, my God! If You had first called the rich, the poor would not have dared to approach You; they would have felt obliged to remain at a distance because of their poverty; they would have watched You from afar, letting the rich surround You. (...) How good You are! How well You have chosen the right means to call all Your children around You at once, without any exception! And what balm You have placed, until the end of time, in the hearts of the poor, the lowly, the despised of the world, by showing them from Your very birth that they are Your privileged ones, Your favorites, the first called: those always called to be around You, who wished to be one of them and to be surrounded by them from Your cradle and throughout Your life.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            God has not linked salvation to knowledge, to intelligence, to wealth, to long experience, to rare gifts that not everyone has received—no. He has linked it to what is accessible to everyone, absolutely everyone, young and old, people of every age and class, of every intellect and fortune. He has linked it to what everyone can give Him, with a little goodwill: a little goodwill is all that is needed to gain this heaven that Jesus links to humility, to making oneself small, to taking the last place, to obeying, which elsewhere He links to poverty of spirit, to purity of heart, to the love of justice, to the spirit of peace. Let us hope, since by God's mercy salvation is so close to us, in our hands, and a little goodwill is enough for us to obtain it.<br />

Book of Judges <font dir="ltr">6:11-24a.</font>@@@@@In those days, the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the Abiezrite clan. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in the winepress to keep it from the Midianites.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “The Lord is with you, mighty warrior!”<br /><br />
Gideon replied, “Pardon me, my Lord, but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers recounted to us? They said, “Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?” But now the Lord has abandoned us and delivered us into the power of Midian…”<br /><br />
Then the Lord looked at Gideon and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Is it not I who am sending you?”<br /><br />
Gideon replied, “Pardon me, my Lord, but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house!”<br /><br />
The Lord answered him, “I will be with you, and you shall strike down the Midianites as if they were but one man.”<br /><br />
Gideon said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you speaking to me.<br /><br />
Do not depart from here until I come back to you. I will bring out my offering and place it before you.” And the Lord answered, “I will stay until you return.”<br /><br />
Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to him under the terebinth and presented them.<br /><br />
The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.<br /><br />
Then the angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. Fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes, and the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.<br /><br />
Then Gideon knew that it was the angel of the Lord, and Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!”<br /><br />
But the Lord said to him, “Peace be with you; do not fear. You shall not die.”<br /><br />
So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it The Lord Is Peace.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">85(84):9,11-14.</font>@@@@@I will listen to what the Lord God will say;<br /><br />
for he speaks of peace<br /><br />
to his people, to his faithful ones;<br /><br />
may they not return to folly!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Love and truth will meet,<br /><br />
justice and peace will embrace;<br /><br />
truth will spring up from the earth,<br /><br />
and justice will look down from heaven.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord will give his benefits,<br /><br />
and our land will yield its fruit.<br /><br />
Justice will walk before him,<br /><br />
and his footsteps will make a way.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">19:23-30.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his disciples, “Amen, I say to you, it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.”<br /><br />
Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”<br /><br />
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?”<br /><br />
Jesus looked at them and said, “For human beings this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”<br /><br />
Then Peter said to him in reply, “We have given up everything and followed you. What, then, will be our lot?”<br /><br />
Jesus said to them, “Amen, I say to you that you who have followed me, in the new age, when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory, will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life.”<br /><br />
But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”<br />
