<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Vigilant Asceticism of the Just</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            “My spirit is faint.” (Job 17:1 Vg) The spirit grows faint in fear of judgment, because the closer the souls of the elect feel to the supreme judgment, the more they tremble with dread in their examination of conscience, and if they discover any carnal thoughts within themselves, they consume them in the fire of penance. (...) The elect beats his breast with all the more profundity as he rigorously awaits the judge, who is already very near.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Hence it is that the elect believe their end is always near. For if the soul of the reprobate often behaves wickedly, it is because it judges itself to have a long time to live in this world. Thus the spirit of the just fades, and that of the unjust strengthens. Indeed, by puffing itself up with pride, it does not know the fading of its spirit. But, by considering the brevity of his life, the just man turns away from the sins of pride and impurity. Hence this addition: “My days are cut short, and only the grave remains for me.” He who considers what he will be in death acts always with fear; and already, as if no longer alive in his own eyes, he lives in all truth in the eyes of Him who formed him. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is in this vigilant asceticism that the just man escapes the snares of sin. Hence this word of Scripture: “In all your acts remember your end, and you will never sin.” (Sirach 7:40 Vg)<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">40:16-21, 34-38.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses carried out everything the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The dwelling of God was erected in the second year after the departure from Egypt, on the first day of the first month.<br /><br />
Moses thus erected the Dwelling: he laid its bases, its beams and its crossbars, and he set up its pillars.<br /><br />
Above the Dwelling, he spread out the Tent and covered it as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark. He put its poles on the ark and covered it with the golden plate called the propitiatory.<br /><br />
He brought the ark into the Dwelling, and put up the curtain to veil the ark of the Testimony, as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The cloud covered the tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Moses could not enter the tent of Meeting, for the cloud remained there and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
At each stage, when the cloud rose and departed from the Dwelling, the sons of Israel set out.<br /><br />
If the cloud did not rise, they remained encamped until the day it rose.<br /><br />
During the day, the cloud of the Lord rested on the Dwelling, and at night, a fire shone in the cloud in the sight of all Israel. And it was so throughout all their stages.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">84(83):3-4, 5-6, 11.</font>@@@@@My soul yearns and pines <br /><br />
for the courts of the Lord; <br /><br />
my heart and my flesh cry out <br /><br />
for the living God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even the sparrow finds a home, <br /><br />
and the swallow a nest for its young: <br /><br />
your altars, Lord of hosts, <br /><br />
my King and my God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are those who dwell in your house: <br /><br />
they will praise you evermore!<br /><br />
Blessed are the people whose strength is in you: <br /><br />
whose hearts are set on pilgrimage!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Indeed, one day in your courts <br /><br />
is better than a thousand elsewhere. <br /><br />
I would rather stand at the threshold <br /><br />
of the house of my God, <br /><br />
than dwell among the unfaithful.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:47-53.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds: “The kingdom of Heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, which catches all kinds of fish.<br /><br />
When it is full, they pull it ashore, sit down, and gather the good fish into baskets, but throw the bad away.<br /><br />
So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous<br /><br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”<br /><br />
“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.”<br /><br />
Jesus added: “Therefore, every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of Heaven is like a master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”<br /><br />
When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.<br />
