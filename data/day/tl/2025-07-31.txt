<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Vigilant Asceticism of the Just</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            “My breath will fail.” (Job 17:1 Vg) Breath fails in fear of judgment, because the closer the soul of the elect feels to the supreme judgment, the more it trembles with dread in its examination of conscience, and if it comes to discover any carnal thoughts within itself, it consumes them in the fire of penance. (…) The elect strikes his breast with all the more profundity as he rigorously awaits the judge, already very near.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Hence it is that the elect believe their end is always near. For if the soul of the reprobate often behaves with wickedness, it is because it judges it has long to live in this world. Thus the breath of the just withers, and that of the unjust strengthens. For by the very fact that he swells with pride, he knows not the withering of his breath. But, considering the brevity of his life, the just turns away from the sins of pride and impurity. Hence this addition: “My days are shortened, and only the grave remains for me.” He who considers what he will be in death never acts but with fear; and already, by no longer being alive, as it were, in his own eyes, he truly lives in the eyes of Him who formed him. (…) <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is in this vigilant asceticism that the just escapes the snares of sin. Hence this word of Scripture: “In all your works remember your last end, and you will never sin.” (Sirach 7:40 Vg)<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">40:16-21, 34-38.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses carried out everything the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The dwelling of God was erected in the second year after the departure from Egypt, on the first day of the first month.<br /><br />
Moses thus erected the Dwelling: he set up its bases, its frames and its crossbars, and he set up the pillars.<br /><br />
Above the Dwelling, he spread out the Tent and covered it as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark. He inserted its poles into the ark and covered it with the gold plate called the mercy seat.<br /><br />
He brought the ark into the Dwelling, and set up the curtain to veil the ark of the Testimony, as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud remained there and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
At each stage, when the cloud rose and left the Dwelling, the sons of Israel broke camp.<br /><br />
If the cloud did not rise, they camped until the day it rose.<br /><br />
During the day, the cloud of the Lord rested on the Dwelling, and at night, a fire glowed in the cloud in the sight of all Israel. And it was so at all their stages.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">84(83):3, 4, 5-6, 11.</font>@@@@@My soul yearns and faints <br /><br />
for the courts of the Lord;<br /><br />
my heart and my flesh cry out<br /><br />
for the living God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even the sparrow finds a home,<br /><br />
and the swallow a nest to shelter her brood:<br /><br />
your altars, Lord of hosts,<br /><br />
my King and my God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are those who dwell in your house;<br /><br />
they will still be singing your praise.<br /><br />
Blessed are those whose strength is in you;<br /><br />
whose hearts are set on pilgrimage!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Indeed, one day in your courts<br /><br />
is better than a thousand elsewhere.<br /><br />
I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God<br /><br />
than dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:47-53.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds: “The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind.<br /><br />
When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw away the bad.<br /><br />
So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous<br /><br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”<br /><br />
“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.”<br /><br />
Jesus added: “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”<br /><br />
When Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there.<br />
