<br /><br />"Blessed are you among women" (Lk 1:42)<br /><br />Who will worthily celebrate the praises of her most holy Assumption? Who can say with what joy she departed from her body, with what joy she saw her Son, with what joy she advanced towards the Lord, surrounded by the choirs of angels, borne by the eager zeal of the apostles, as she contemplated the King in His beauty and saw her child awaiting her in glory, free from all suffering as she had been free from every blemish? She left the dwelling of her body to dwell eternally with Christ. She passed into the vision of God, and her blessed soul, brighter than the sun, higher than the heaven, nobler than the angels, she breathed it forth to the Lord. (...)<br /><br /><br /><br />Is this not life, when one goes to the source of life? and from life, one draws eternal life in an unceasing flow? Before her departure, the Virgin Mother had already drunk from this inexhaustible source, so that in her very passage, she would not be touched by the slightest taste of death. This is why, as she departed, she saw life, so that she did not see death. She saw her Son, so that she did not suffer the separation of the flesh. Leaping forth, then, freed, into such a blessed vision and quenching her thirst at the so-desired face of God, she finds the venerable inhabitants of heaven ready to serve and lead her.

<br /><br />Book of Revelation 11:19a, 12:1-6a, 10ab.<br /><br />God’s sanctuary in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his sanctuary.<br /><br />A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br /><br />She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.<br /><br />Then another sign appeared in the sky: a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems.<br /><br />Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child the moment it was born.<br /><br />She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod. Her child was caught up to God and to his throne.<br /><br />The woman herself fled into the desert where she had a place prepared by God.<br /><br />Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:<br /><br />“Now have salvation and power come, and the Kingdom of our God and the authority of his Anointed One.”

<br /><br />Psalm 45(44):11-12a, 12b-13, 14-15a, 15b-16.<br /><br />Hear, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear;<br /><br />forget your people and your father’s house:<br /><br />and the king will desire your beauty.<br /><br />He is your lord: bow to him.<br /><br />The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;<br /><br />the richest of the people will seek your favor.<br /><br />All glorious is the princess in her chamber,<br /><br />with robes interwoven with gold;<br /><br />in many-colored robes she is led to the king.<br /><br />With her virgin companions, who follow her, she is brought to you;<br /><br />with joy and gladness they are led along<br /><br />as they enter the palace of the king.

<br /><br />Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 1:39-56.<br /><br />In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country,<br /><br />where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.<br /><br />When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit,<br /><br />cried out in a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.<br /><br />And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br /><br />For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.<br /><br />Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.”<br /><br />And Mary said: “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;<br /><br />my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br /><br />for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br /><br />From this day all generations will call me blessed:<br /><br />the Almighty has done great things for me,<br /><br />and holy is his Name.<br /><br />He has mercy on those who fear him<br /><br />in every generation.<br /><br />He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br /><br />He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly.<br /><br />He has filled the hungry with good things,<br /><br />and has sent the rich away empty.<br /><br />He has come to the help of his servant Israel<br /><br />for he remembered his promise of mercy,<br /><br />the promise he made to our fathers,<br /><br />to Abraham and his children forever.”<br /><br />Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.

<br /><br />First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:20-27a.<br /><br />Brothers and sisters: Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br /><br />For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a human being.<br /><br />For just as in Adam all die, so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,<br /><br />but each in proper order: Christ the firstfruits; then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ.<br /><br />Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has destroyed every sovereignty and every authority and power.<br /><br />For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.<br /><br />The last enemy to be destroyed is death,<br /><br />for “he subjected everything under his feet.”
