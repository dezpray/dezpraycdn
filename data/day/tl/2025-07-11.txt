<font style="text-align:left" dir="ltr">Called to Choose to Love and Be Loved</font>

<font style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      We are all capable of doing good as well as doing evil. We are not born evil: everyone has something good within them; some hide it, others neglect it, but the goodness is there. God created us to love and be loved; thus choosing one path or the other is a kind of test sent by God. Neglecting to love can lead us to say 'yes' to evil, and then we don't realize how far it can lead us... <br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Fortunately, we have the power to overcome everything through prayer. If we turn to God, we spread joy and love to all those around us. Conversely, if evil takes hold of someone, that person can spread evil around them. If we are in contact with such a person, let us do everything to help them and show them that God always cares for them. Let us pray fervently that they may rediscover prayer, that they may see God within themselves again and find Him in others... We were all created by the same loving hand. The love of Christ is always stronger than evil in the world. Therefore, we must love and be loved. It's as simple as that, and it shouldn't be such a struggle to achieve it.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">2:1-15a.</font>
In those days, a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman from the same tribe.<br /><br />
She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Seeing that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.<br /><br />
When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket and coated it with bitumen and pitch. She placed the child in it and set the basket among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.<br /><br />
The child’s sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.<br /><br />
Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the river to bathe, while her attendants walked along the bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.<br /><br />
When she opened it, she saw the child. He was a baby boy, and he was crying. She felt pity for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.”<br /><br />
Then the child’s sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get you a Hebrew woman to nurse the child for you?”<br /><br />
Pharaoh’s daughter replied, “Go.” So the girl went and got the child’s mother.<br /><br />
Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.<br /><br />
When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who treated him as her own son. She named him Moses, saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.”<br /><br />
One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.<br /><br />
Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<br /><br />
The next day he went out again and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”<br /><br />
The man retorted, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”<br /><br />
When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">69(68):3,14,30-31,33-34.</font>
I sink in the mire of the depths, <br /><br />where there is no foothold;<br /><br />I have come into the deep waters, <br /><br />and the floods engulf me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD,<br /><br />at an acceptable time;<br /><br />in your abundant love, O God, answer me, <br /><br />with your faithful salvation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But I am afflicted and in pain;<br /><br />let your salvation, O God, protect me.<br /><br />I will praise the name of God with a song;<br /><br />I will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The humble see it and rejoice;<br /><br />you who seek God, may your hearts revive!<br /><br />For the LORD hears the needy,<br /><br />and does not despise his own who are in bonds.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11:20-24.</font>
At that time, Jesus began to reproach the cities where most of his miracles had been performed, because they had not repented:<br /><br />
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.<br /><br />
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgment than for you.<br /><br />
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades! For if the miracles performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.<br /><br />
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you.”<br />
