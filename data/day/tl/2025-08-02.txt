<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you" (Matt 11:10; Mal 3:1)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            "The memory of the righteous is accompanied by praises" (Prov 10:7), but for you, the Forerunner, the Lord's testimony suffices. Truly, you showed yourself to be "the greatest of all the prophets" (Matt 11:9); that is why you were worthy to baptize in the waters Him whom they had announced. And having struggled on earth for the truth, full of joy, you announced even to the abode of the dead God manifested in the flesh, He who takes away the sin of the world (1 Tim 3:16; John 1:29) and who grants us the grace of salvation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            By the will of God, you came forth from a barren woman, you broke the bonds of your father's tongue (Luke 1:7,64), you showed the Sun, who illuminated you, the morning star. In the desert, you preached to the peoples the Creator, the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). In your zeal you reprimanded the king and your glorious head was decapitated, you, the illustrious Forerunner, truly worthy of our songs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Intercede with Christ our God, that He may grant the forgiveness of their sins to those who celebrate your sacred memory with all their heart.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">25:1,8-17.</font>@@@@@The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:<br /><br />
"You shall count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the total time of the seven weeks of years will be forty-nine years.<br /><br />
On the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, you shall sound the trumpet for the jubilee; on that day, throughout your land, you shall sound the trumpet.<br /><br />
You shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.<br /><br />
That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; you shall not sow, nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather the grapes from the untended vine.<br /><br />
For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat what the field itself produces.<br /><br />
In this year of jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession.<br /><br />
If you sell to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.<br /><br />
When you buy from your neighbor, you shall reckon with him according to the number of years since the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years of crops.<br /><br />
The more years remain, the more you shall increase the price; and the fewer years remain, the more you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of crops that he is selling to you.<br /><br />
You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God."<br />

<br /><br />
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, <br /><br />for you judge the peoples with equity <br /><br />and guide the nations upon earth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The earth has yielded its increase; <br /><br />God, our God, blesses us.<br /><br />
May God bless us, <br /><br />and may all the ends of the earth adore him! <br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">14:1-12.</font>@@@@@At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,<br /><br />and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and therefore mighty works are at work in him."<br /><br />
For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.<br /><br />
For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."<br /><br />
And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they held him to be a prophet.<br /><br />
But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,<br /><br />
so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.<br /><br />
Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."<br /><br />
And the king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given.<br /><br />
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.<br /><br />
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.<br /><br />
And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.<br />
