Of Trust and Perseverance in Prayer@@@@@<br />
      As long as we have not acquired true prayer, we resemble those who begin to teach children to walk.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Strive to elevate your thought, or rather to enclose it within the words of prayer; and if, because of its infantile state, it falters and falls, bring it back again. Instability is inherent to the intellect, but God has the power to make it stable. If you persevere tirelessly in this struggle, He who set boundaries for the sea of the intellect will also come to you and say to it during your prayer: “You shall come thus far and no farther” (Job 38, 11). The spirit cannot be enchained; but where the Creator of the spirit is, all is subject to Him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Faith gives wings to prayer; without it, indeed, we cannot fly up to heaven.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Book of Genesis 18:20-32.@@@@@In those days, Abraham’s three visitors were about to depart for Sodom.<br /><br />
Then the Lord said: “How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah! And their sin, how grave it is!<br /><br />
I will go down now to see if what they have done corresponds to the outcry that has reached me. If it is not so, I shall know it.”<br /><br />
The men turned from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the Lord.<br /><br />
Abraham came closer and said: “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?<br /><br />
Perhaps there are fifty righteous people in the city. Will you indeed sweep them away? Will you not forgive the whole city for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?<br /><br />
Far be it from you to do such a thing! To slay the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous in the same way as the wicked—far be it from you to act in this way! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”<br /><br />
The Lord declared: “If I find fifty righteous people in Sodom, for their sake I will forgive the whole city.”<br /><br />
Abraham replied: “I who am but dust and ashes dare to speak to my Lord again.<br /><br />
Perhaps five of the fifty righteous will be lacking; will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” He declared: “No, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”<br /><br />
Abraham insisted: “Perhaps only forty will be found there?” The Lord declared: “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”<br /><br />
Abraham said: “Let not my Lord be angry if I speak once more. Perhaps only thirty will be found there?” He declared: “If I find thirty there, I will not do it.”<br /><br />
Abraham said then: “I dare to speak to my Lord again. Perhaps only twenty will be found there?” He declared: “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”<br /><br />
He said: “Let not my Lord be angry: I will speak but once more. Perhaps only ten will be found there?” And the Lord declared: “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”<br />

Psalm 138(137):1-2a, 2bc-3, 6-7ab, 7c-8.@@@@@With all my heart I thank you, Lord;<br /><br />
you have heard the words of my mouth.<br /><br />
In the presence of the angels I sing your praise,<br /><br />
toward your holy temple I bow down.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I give thanks to your name for your love and your truth,<br /><br />
for you have exalted above all your name and your word.<br /><br />
On the day you answered my call,<br /><br />
you made strength grow in my soul.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Though the Lord is high, he sees the lowly;<br /><br />
from afar he knows the proud.<br /><br />
Though I walk in the midst of distress, you preserve me,<br /><br />
your hand falls upon my angry enemies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your right hand delivers me.<br /><br />
The Lord will accomplish all things for me!<br /><br />
Lord, your love is eternal:<br /><br />
do not abandon the work of your hands.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 11:1-13.@@@@@It happened that Jesus was in a certain place, praying. When he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John the Baptist also taught his disciples.”<br /><br />
He replied to them, “When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.<br /><br />
Give us each day our daily bread.<br /><br />
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.”<br /><br />
Jesus also said to them, “Imagine that one of you has a friend and goes to him in the middle of the night to ask him: ‘My friend, lend me three loaves,<br /><br />
for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey, and I have nothing to offer him.’<br /><br />
And if, from inside, the other replies to him: ‘Do not bother me! The door is already shut; my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’<br /><br />
Well, I tell you: even if he will not get up to give for friendship, he will get up because of this friend’s shameless persistence, and he will give him whatever he needs.<br /><br />
And I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.<br /><br />
For everyone who asks receives; whoever searches finds; and to whoever knocks, the door will be opened.<br /><br />
What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?<br /><br />
Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<br /><br />
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:12-14.@@@@@Brothers and sisters, in baptism you were buried with Christ, and with him you were raised through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.<br /><br />
You were dead because of your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. But God made you alive together with Christ, when he forgave us all our trespasses.<br /><br />
He canceled the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.<br />
