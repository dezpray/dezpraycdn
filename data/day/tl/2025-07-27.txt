<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">On Trust and Perseverance in Prayer</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      As long as we have not acquired true prayer, we are like those who begin to teach children to walk.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Strive to elevate your thought, or rather to enclose it within the words of prayer;&nbsp;and if, because of its infantile state, it weakens and falls, bring it back again. Instability is characteristic of the intellect, but God has the power to make it stable. If you persevere indefatigably in this struggle, He who set bounds to the sea of the intellect will also come to you and say to it during your prayer:&nbsp;“You shall go thus far and no farther” (Job 38:11). The spirit cannot be chained;&nbsp;but where the Creator of the spirit is, everything is subject to Him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Faith gives wings to prayer;&nbsp;for without it, we cannot fly to heaven.<br /><br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">18:20-32.</font>@@@@@In those days, Abraham’s three visitors were about to depart for Sodom.<br /><br />
Then the Lord said, “Great indeed is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah! And their sin, how grave it is!<br /><br />
I will go down to see whether their conduct corresponds to the outcry that has reached me. If it is not so, I will know.”<br /><br />
The men headed towards Sodom, while Abraham remained before the Lord.<br /><br />
Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?<br /><br />
Perhaps there are fifty righteous people in the city. Will you indeed sweep them away? And will you not forgive the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?<br /><br />
Far be it from you to do such a thing! To slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”<br /><
The Lord said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous people in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake.”<br /><br />
Abraham answered, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.<br /><br />
Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking: will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “No, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”<br /><br />
Abraham persisted, “Perhaps forty will be found there?” The Lord said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”<br /><br />
Abraham said, “Oh let not my Lord be angry, if I venture to speak again. Perhaps thirty will be found there?” He said, “If I find thirty there, I will not do it.”<br /><br />
Abraham said then, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord again. Perhaps twenty will be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”<br /><br />
He said, “Oh let not my Lord be angry: I will speak again but this once. Perhaps ten will be found there?” And the Lord said, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">138(137):1-2a.2bc-3.6-7ab.7c-8.</font>@@@@@I give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart;<br /><br />
you heard the words of my mouth.<br /><br />
I sing your praise before the angels,<br /><br />
I bow down toward your holy temple.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness,<br /><br />
for you have exalted above all things your name and your word.<br /><br />
On the day I called, you answered me;<br /><br />
you made me bold with strength in my soul.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly;<br /><br />
but the haughty he knows from afar.<br /><br />
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life;<br /><br />
you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your right hand delivers me.<br /><br />
The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me! <br /><br />
O Lord, your steadfast love endures forever:<br /><br />
do not forsake the work of your hands.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11:1-13.</font>@@@@@It happened that Jesus was in a certain place praying, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.<br /><br />
Give us each day our daily bread.<br /><br />
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.’”<br /><br />
Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,<br /><br />
for a friend of mine has arrived from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’;<br /><br />
and from within he answers, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’<br /><br />
I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.<br /><br />
And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.<br /><br />
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.<br /><br />
What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;<br /><br />
or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<br /><br />
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">2:12-14.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters, you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.<br /><br />
And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,<br /><br />
by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.<br />
