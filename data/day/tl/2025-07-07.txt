<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Purity of Faith</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            “Do you think that, when the Son of Man comes, he will find faith on earth&amp;nbsp;?” (Lk 18:8) Let those who put forward this sentence from the Gospel know that the faith mentioned here is that of which the Lord said&amp;nbsp;: “Your faith has saved you” (Mt 9:22). And elsewhere, concerning the centurion&amp;nbsp;: “I have not found such faith in Israel” (Mt 8:10). (…) Neither the centurion, nor that poor woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years (Mk 5:25), believed in the mystery of the Trinity, which was manifested to the Apostles after the resurrection of Christ, (...) but it is the simplicity of their heart and their soul given to their God that are approved here. “She said to herself&amp;nbsp;: if I only touch the fringe of his garment, I shall be saved!” (Mt 9:21) This is the faith of which the Lord said it is rarely found! This is the faith which, even among those who believe, is hardly perfect! “According to your faith be it done to you,” said the Lord (Mt 8:13).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            This word, I desire not to hear it! Indeed, if it were to be done to me according to my faith, I would perish. Certainly, “I believe in God the Father, I believe in God the Son, I believe in the Holy Spirit who is God, I believe in one God,” and yet I do not want it to be done to me “according to my faith.” Often, indeed, the enemy comes and, in the midst of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s harvest, he sows weeds. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            In reality, many times, in my prayer, I wander through the streets, I calculate interests, or, carried away by shameful reverie, I occupy myself with what I would blush to speak of. Where is faith? Let each one question his own heart and, in life, he will see how rare it is to find a soul faithful to the point of doing nothing out of desire for glory nor anything for &amp;lsquo;what people will say.&amp;rsquo; (...) Indeed, vices are neighbors to virtues. It is difficult to be content with having God alone as judge.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">28:10-22a.</font>@@@@@In those days, Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran.<br /><br />
He reached the place where he was to spend the night because the sun had set. He took a stone there to put under his head, and slept in that place.<br /><br />
He had a dream: behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.<br /><br />
The Lord stood beside him. He said: “I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants.<br /><br />
Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south; and in you and in your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.<br /><br />
Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”<br /><br />
Jacob awoke from his sleep and said: “Surely the Lord is in this place! And I did not know it.”<br /><br />
He was afraid and said: “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!”<br /><br />
Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on its top.<br /><br />
Jacob called the name of that place Bethel (that is: House of God), but the name of the city was Luz at the first.<br /><br />
Then Jacob made a vow, saying: “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,<br /><br />
and if I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God.<br /><br />
And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God's house.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">91(90):1-2, 3a, 4, 14, 15ab.</font>@@@@@He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High <br /><br />and abides in the shadow of the Almighty,<br /><br />
will say to the Lord, “My refuge <br /><br />and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust!”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler<br /><br />and from the deadly pestilence. <br /><br />He will cover you with his pinions, <br /><br />and under his wings you will find refuge; <br /><br />his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; <br /><br />I will protect him, because he knows my name.<br /><br />When he calls to me, I will answer him; <br /><br />I will be with him in trouble.”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9:18-26.</font>@@@@@At that time, while Jesus was speaking to John the Baptist's disciples, behold, a ruler came up and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”<br /><br />
Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.<br /><br />
And behold, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment.<br /><br />
For she said to herself: “If I only touch his garment, I will be saved.”<br /><br />
Jesus turned, and seeing her, he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well.<br /><br />
When Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, he said:<br /><br />
“Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” But they laughed at him.<br /><br />
But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.<br /><br />
And the report of this went through all that district.<br />
