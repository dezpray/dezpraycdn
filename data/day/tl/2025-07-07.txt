« Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers »@@@@@<br />
Holy Father, inexhaustible source of existence and love, <br /><br />
who show in living man the splendor of your glory, <br /><br />
and who place in his heart the seed of your call, <br /><br />
grant that no one, through our negligence, may ignore or lose this gift, <br /><br />
but that all may walk with great generosity <br /><br />
towards the realization of your Love.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lord Jesus, who during your pilgrimage on the roads of Palestine, <br /><br />
chose and called the apostles <br /><br />
and entrusted them with the task of preaching the Gospel, <br /><br />
of feeding the faithful, of celebrating divine worship, <br /><br />
grant that, today too, your Church may not lack <br /><br />
holy priests who bring to all <br /><br />
the fruits of your death and resurrection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Holy Spirit, you who sanctify the Church <br /><br />
with the constant outpouring of your gifts, <br /><br />
place in the hearts of those called to consecrated life <br /><br />
an intimate and strong passion for the Kingdom, <br /><br />
so that with a generous and unconditional « yes » <br /><br />
they may place their existence at the service of the Gospel.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Most Holy Virgin, you who without hesitation <br /><br />
offered yourself to the Almighty <br /><br />
for the realization of His saving plan, <br /><br />
stir up confidence in the hearts of young people <br /><br />
so that there may always be zealous pastors, <br /><br />
who guide the Christian people on the path of life, <br /><br />
and consecrated souls able to bear witness <br /><br />
through chastity, poverty, and obedience, <br /><br />
to the liberating presence of your Risen Son. <br /><br />
Amen.<br />

Book of Genesis 32:23-32.@@@@@That same night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.<br /><br />
He had them cross the stream, and he sent over everything he had.<br /><br />
So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.<br /><br />
When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.<br /><br />
Then the man said, « Let me go, for it is daybreak. » But Jacob replied, « I will not let you go unless you bless me. »<br /><br />
The man asked him, « What is your name? » « Jacob, » he answered.<br /><br />
Then the man said, « Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel (that is: God struggles), because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome. »<br /><br />
Jacob said, « Please tell me your name. » But he replied, « Why do you ask my name? » And he blessed him there.<br /><br />
So Jacob called the place Peniel (that is: Face of God), saying, « It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared. »<br /><br />
The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.<br />

Psalm 17 (16):1, 2-3ab, 6-7, 8, 15.@@@@@Hear a just cause, Lord;<br /><br />
Listen to my cry, hear my prayer:<br /><br />
from lips free of deceit.<br /><br />
May my vindication come from you;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
may your eyes see what is right.<br /><br />
Though you probe my heart, though you examine me at night,<br /><br />
you test me and find nothing.<br /><br />
I call on you, my God, for you will answer me;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.<br /><br />
Show the wonders of your great love,<br /><br />
you who save by your right hand<br /><br />
those who take refuge in you from their foes.<br /><br />
Keep me as the apple of your eye;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
hide me in the shadow of your wings,<br /><br />
As for me, by your justice, I will see your face:<br /><br />
when I awake, I will be satisfied with your likeness.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 9:32-38.@@@@@At that time, there was brought to Jesus a demon-possessed man who was mute.<br /><br />
And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, « Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel! »<br /><br />
But the Pharisees said, « It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons. »<br /><br />
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.<br /><br />
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.<br /><br />
Then he said to his disciples, « The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.<br /><br />
Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest. »<br />
