<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“He appointed twelve”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            The Lord had begun by calling the Twelve, through whom the future People of God was represented. Faithful to the mandate received from the Lord, the Twelve, after His Ascension, gradually associated other individuals with the functions entrusted to them, so that they might continue their ministry. (...) This is the path by which this ministry would continue, which, subsequently, beginning with the second generation, would be called the episcopal ministry, the ministry of bishops. (...) Thus, the succession of the episcopal office appears as the continuity of the apostolic ministry, a guarantee of perseverance in the apostolic Tradition.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            The link between the college of bishops and the original community of apostles is first understood from the perspective of historical continuity. As we have seen, Matthew was first associated with the Twelve, then Paul, then Barnabas, then others, until the formation of the ministry of the Bishop. (…) And in the continuity of the succession lies the guarantee of perseverance in the ecclesial community, of the apostolic college gathered around Him by Christ. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            But this continuity is also understood in a spiritual sense, for apostolic succession in ministry is considered the privileged place for the action and transmission of the Holy Spirit. A clear echo of these convictions is found, for example, in the following text from Irenaeus of Lyons: “The tradition of the Apostles, manifested throughout the whole world, is evident in every Church to all who wish to see the truth, and we can enumerate the Bishops established by the Apostles in the Churches and their successors down to us. (The Apostles) indeed desired that those whom they left as their successors should be absolutely perfect and irreproachable in every respect, by transmitting to them their mission of teaching.”<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">41:55-57; 42:5-7a, 17-24a.</font>@@@@@In those days, the whole land of Egypt suffered from famine, and the people cried out loudly for bread to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.”<br /><br />
The famine spread over all the land. So Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, while the famine grew even worse in the land.<br /><br />
From all over, people came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, for the famine was severe everywhere.<br /><br />
So the sons of Israel, that is, Jacob, among many other people, came to buy grain, for the famine was severe in the land of Canaan.<br /><br />
It was Joseph who was selling grain to all the people of the land, for he had full authority in the land. When they arrived, Joseph’s brothers bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.<br /><br />
As soon as he saw them, he recognized them, but he behaved like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them.<br /><br />
He held them in custody for three days.<br /><br />
On the third day, he said to them, “Do as I tell you, and you will live, for I fear God.<br /><br />
If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in your prison. As for you, go and take what grain is needed to relieve your households from famine.<br /><br />
Then bring me your youngest brother; thus your words will be verified, and you will not die.” They agreed,<br /><br />
and they said to one another, “Alas! We are indeed guilty concerning our brother Joseph: we saw his distress when he pleaded with us, and we would not listen. That is why we are now in such distress.”<br /><br />
Then Reuben spoke up: “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not commit this crime against our young brother!’ But you would not listen, and now we must account for his blood.”<br /><br />
Since there was an interpreter, they did not realize that Joseph understood them.<br /><br />
Then Joseph withdrew to weep.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">33(32):2-3, 10-11, 18-19.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre, <br /><br />
play to him on the ten-stringed harp.<br /><br />
Sing to him a new song, <br /><br />
with all your skill, support the ovation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord has thwarted the plans of the nations, <br /><br />
frustrated the schemes of the peoples.<br /><br />
The Lord’s plan stands forever, <br /><br />
the designs of his heart through all generations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
God watches over those who fear him, <br /><br />
who put their hope in his love,<br /><br />
to deliver them from death, <br /><br />
to keep them alive in times of famine.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10:1-7.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.<br /><br />
These are the names of the twelve Apostles: first, Simon, called Peter; and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br /><br />
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;<br /><br />
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.<br /><br />
These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them thus: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans.<br /><br />
“But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br /><br />
And as you go, proclaim, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’”<br />
