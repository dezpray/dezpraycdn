Let us be mindful of our neighbor!@@@@@<br />
            Let us attend to our neighbor's health with as much care as our own, whether they are well or exhausted by illness. For "we are all one in the Lord" (Rom 12:5): rich or poor, slaves or free men, healthy or sick. For all, there is only one head, the principle of everything: Christ.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            What the members of the body are to one another, each of us is to each of our brothers, and all are to all. Therefore, we must neither neglect nor abandon those who have fallen before us into a state of weakness that awaits us all. Rather than rejoicing in our good health, it is better to feel compassion for the misfortunes of our brothers. They are in the image of God like us and, despite their apparent decline, they have kept the faithfulness of that image better than we have. In them, the inner man has put on the same Christ and they have received the same "pledge of the Spirit" (2 Cor 5:5). They have the same laws, the same commandments, the same covenants, the same assemblies, the same mysteries, the same hope. Christ also died for them, "He who takes away the sin of the world" (Jn 1:29). They share in the inheritance of heavenly life, they who were deprived of many good things here below. They are companions in Christ's sufferings, and they will be in his glory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Human nature makes it a law for us to have pity on one another. By teaching us solidarity in weakness, it instills in us respect and love for humanity.<br />

Book of Deuteronomy 30,10-14.@@@@@Moses said to the people: "Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, by observing his commandments and his decrees written in this book of the Law, and return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.<br /><br />
For this law that I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it beyond your reach.<br /><br />
It is not in heaven, that you should say: 'Who will ascend to heaven for us to get it, and make us hear it, so that we may obey it?'<br /><br />
It is not beyond the sea, that you should say: 'Who will cross the sea for us to get it, and make us hear it, so that we may obey it?'<br /><br />
No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may obey it."<br />

Psalm 69(68),14.17.30-31.33-34.36ab.37.@@@@@But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord:<br /><br />
this is a time of favor;<br /><br />
in your great love, O God, answer me,<br /><br />
by your faithfulness save me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Answer me, O Lord,<br /><br />
for your steadfast love is good;<br /><br />
according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.<br /><br />
But I am afflicted and in pain;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
let your salvation, O God, set me on high.<br /><br />
I will praise the name of God with a song;<br /><br />
I will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br /><br />
The humble will see and rejoice;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"You who seek God, let your hearts revive!"<br /><br />
For the Lord hears the needy,<br /><br />
and does not despise his own who are in prison.<br /><br />
For God will save Zion,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and rebuild the cities of Judah:<br /><br />
a heritage for the descendants of his servants,<br /><br />
and those who love his name will live in it.<br />

The Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 10,25-37.@@@@@At that time, a scholar of the law stood up to test Jesus and said: "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"<br /><br />
He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"<br /><br />
He said in reply, "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."<br /><br />
He replied to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."<br /><br />
But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"<br /><
<br />
Jesus replied, "A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off, leaving him half-dead.<br /><br />
A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br /><br />
Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br /><br />
But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.<br /><br />
He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn, and cared for him.<br /><br />
The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you spend anything more, I will repay you on my way back.'<br /><br />
Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the man who fell in with the robbers?"<br /><br />
The scholar of the law replied, "The one who treated him with mercy." Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1,15-20.@@@@@He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.<br /><br />
For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things were created through him and for him.<br /><
<br />
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.<br /><br />
He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.<br /><br />
For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,<br /><br />
and through him to reconcile all things to himself, making peace by the blood of his cross (through him), whether those on earth or those in heaven.<br />
