« He broke the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd »@@@@@
The simplicity of our contemplative life: it makes us see the face of God in everything, in every being, everywhere and always! And His hand, present in every event, enables us to accomplish everything — meditation and study, work and exchange, eating and sleeping — in Jesus, with Jesus, for Jesus, and with regard to Jesus, under the loving gaze of the Father, while we remain always ready to receive Him in whatever form He may assume.


I am captivated by the fact that, before commenting on the Word of God, before announcing the Beatitudes to the crowds, Jesus, taking them into compassion, healed and fed them. And only afterwards did He begin to deliver His teaching to them.


Love Jesus generously, love Him with confidence, without looking back, and without apprehension. Give yourself entirely to Jesus. He will take you as an instrument to accomplish wonders, provided that you are infinitely more conscious of His love than of your weakness. Believe in Him, entrust yourself into His hands in a surge of blind and absolute trust, for He is Jesus. Believe that Jesus, and Jesus alone, is life; know that holiness is nothing other than this same Jesus living intimately within you; then His hand will be free to act upon you.

@@@@@« My people did not listen to my voice, 

Israel did not want me.

I gave them over to their hardened hearts:

let them go and follow their own counsels!


« Oh, if my people would listen to me, 

Israel, if they would walk in my ways!

I would soon humble their enemies, 

and turn my hand against their oppressors.


« My adversaries would cower before them; 

such would be their fate forever!

I would feed them with the finest of wheat, 

and satisfy you with honey from the rock!"
