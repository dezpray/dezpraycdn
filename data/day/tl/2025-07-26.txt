<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Let them grow together until the harvest"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      There are scandals in the Church, blameworthy and shameful things; no Catholic can deny it. She has always incurred the reproach and shame of being the mother of unworthy sons; she has children who are good, she has many more who are bad... God could have instituted a pure Church; but He predicted that the weeds sown by the enemy would remain with the wheat until the harvest, at the end of the world. He affirmed that His Church would be like a fisherman's net "which gathers fish of every kind" which are not sorted before evening (Mt 13:47ff). Going further still, He declared that the bad and the imperfect would greatly outnumber the good. "Many are called," He said, "but few are chosen" (Mt 22:14), and His apostle says "that there is a remnant, chosen by grace" (Rm 11:5). There is therefore constantly, in history and in the life of Catholics, ample material to play into the hands of contradictors...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      But we do not hang our heads in shame, to hide our faces in our hands: we raise our hands and our faces towards our Redeemer. "As the eyes of servants toward the hand of their master..., so our eyes toward the Lord our God, until He has pity on us" (Ps 122:2)... We appeal to you, just judge, for it is you who watches over us. We pay no heed to men, as long as we have you..., as long as we have your presence in our assemblies, your testimony and your approval in our hearts.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">24:3-8.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses came and reported to the people all the words of the Lord and all His ordinances. All the people answered with one voice: "All these words that the Lord has spoken, we will put into practice."<br /><br />
Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and he set up twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
Then he sent some young men from among the sons of Israel to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice bulls to the Lord as peace offerings.<br /><br />
Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls; then he sprinkled the altar with the rest of the blood.<br /><br />
He took the book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people. They answered: "All that the Lord has said, we will put into practice, we will obey it."<br /><br />
Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said: "This is the blood of the Covenant that, based on all these words, the Lord has concluded with you."<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">50(49):1-2, 5, 7ac, 14-15.</font>@@@@@The God of gods, the Lord, <br /><br />
speaks and summons the earth <br /><br />
from the rising of the sun to its setting:<br /><br />
From Zion, most beautiful of all, God shines forth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"Gather to me my faithful ones, <br /><br />
those who seal my covenant with sacrifice."<br /><br />
"Hear, my people, I speak.<br /><br />
I, God, am your God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br /><br />
and fulfill your vows to the Most High.<br /><br />
Call upon me in the day of trouble: <br /><br />
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:24-30.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus proposed this parable to the crowd: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.<br /><br />
But while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.<br /><br />
When the stalk grew and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.<br /><br />
The master's servants came and said to him, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then does it have weeds?"<br /><br />
He said to them, "An enemy has done this." The servants said to him, "Do you want us then to go and gather them up?"<br /><br />
He replied, "No, for in gathering the weeds, you would uproot the wheat along with them.<br /><br />
Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time, I will tell the reapers, "Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn." "<br />
