<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Let them grow together until the harvest”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      There are scandals in the Church, blameworthy and shameful things; no Catholic can deny it. She has always incurred reproach and shame for being the mother of unworthy sons; she has children who are good, she has many more who are bad... God could have instituted a Church that is pure; but He predicted that the weeds sown by the enemy would remain with the wheat until the harvest, at the end of the world. He affirmed that His Church would be like a fisherman's net “which gathers fish of all kinds” that are not sorted until the evening (Mt 13:47ff). Going even further, He declared that the bad and the imperfect would far outnumber the good. “Many are called,” He said, “but few are chosen” (Mt 22:14), and His apostle says “that there is a remnant chosen by grace” (Rom 11:5). Thus, ceaselessly, in history and in the lives of Catholics, there is ample material for opponents to exploit...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      But we do not bow our heads in shame, to hide our faces in our hands: we raise our hands and our faces to our Redeemer. “As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master..., so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us” (Ps 122:2)... We appeal to you, righteous judge, for it is you who watches over us. We make no account of men, as long as we have you..., as long as we have your presence in our assemblies, your testimony and your approval in our hearts.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">24:3-8.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses went and told the people all the words of the Lord and all His ordinances. All the people answered with one voice, “All the words that the Lord has spoken, we will do.”<br /><br />
Moses wrote all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
Then he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of bulls to the Lord.<br /><br />
Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins; then he splashed the altar with the rest of the blood.<br /><br />
He took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”<br /><br />
Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">50(49):1-2, 5, 7ac, 14-15.</font>@@@@@The God of gods, the Lord,<br /><br />
speaks and summons the earth<br /><br />
from the rising of the sun to its setting:<br /><br />
From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“Gather to me my faithful ones,<br /><br />
who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!”<br /><br />
“Hear, O my people, and I will speak;<br /><br />
I am God, your God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,<br /><br />
and pay your vows to the Most High.<br /><br />
Call upon me in the day of trouble;<br /><br />
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:24-30.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus proposed this parable to the crowds: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.<br /><br />
But while people slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.<br /><br />
So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.<br /><br />
And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’<br /><br />
He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’<br /><br />
But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you uproot the wheat along with them.<br /><br />
Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”<br />
