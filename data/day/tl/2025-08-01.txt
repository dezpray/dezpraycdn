<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Is this not the carpenter’s son?”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            The communion of life between Joseph and Jesus leads us to consider the mystery of the Incarnation from the perspective of Christ’s humanity, an effective instrument of divinity for the sanctification of humanity: “By virtue of His divinity, the human actions of Christ were salvific for us, producing grace in us both by merit and by a certain efficacy” (St. Thomas Aquinas).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Among these actions, the evangelists prioritize those concerning the Paschal mystery, but they do not fail to emphasize the importance of physical contact with Jesus... The apostolic testimony did not neglect to describe the birth of Jesus, the circumcision, the presentation in the Temple, the flight into Egypt, and the hidden life in Nazareth, and this due to the mystery of grace contained in such gestures, all salvific, because they partake of the same source of love: the divinity of Christ. If this love, through His humanity, radiated upon all humanity, the primary beneficiaries were obviously those whom divine will had placed in His closest intimacy: Mary, His mother, and Joseph, His putative father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Since Joseph's paternal love could not but influence Jesus’ filial love, and reciprocally, Jesus’ filial love could not but influence Joseph’s paternal love, how can one come to know this utterly singular relationship in depth? Souls most sensitive to the impulses of divine love rightly see in Joseph a luminous example of interior life.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">23:1, 4-11, 15-16, 27, 34b-37.</font>@@@@@The Lord spoke to Moses and said:<br /><br />
These are the Lord’s appointed feasts, the holy convocations, which you are to proclaim at their appointed times.<br /><br />
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, is the Lord’s Passover.<br /><br />
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br /><br />
On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.<br /><br />
For seven days you shall present food offerings to the Lord. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.’”<br /><br />
The Lord spoke to Moses and said:<br /><br />
“Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land that I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest,<br /><br />
and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, so that you may be accepted. On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.<br /><br />
You shall count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering.<br /><br />
You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you shall present a new grain offering to the Lord.<br /><br />
“On the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be for you a day of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves and present a food offering to the Lord.<br /><br />
“On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the Feast of Booths to the Lord.<br /><br />
On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.<br /><br />
For seven days you shall present food offerings to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present a food offering to the Lord. It is a solemn assembly; you shall not do any ordinary work.<br /><br />
“These are the appointed feasts of the Lord, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, for presenting to the Lord food offerings, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day,”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">81(80):3-4, 5-6ab, 10-11ab.</font>@@@@@Play music, strike the tambourine, <br /><br />the sweet lyre and harp.<br /><br />
Sound the ram’s horn at the new moon, <br /><br />at the full moon, on our feast day.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For this is a statute for Israel, <br /><br />an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br /><br />
He made it a decree for Joseph <br /><br />when he went out over the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“There shall be no strange god among you; <br /><br />you shall not bow down to a foreign god.<br /><br />
I am the Lord your God, <br /><br />who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:54-58.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus came to his hometown and began teaching the people in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?<br /><br />
Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother named Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?<br /><br />
And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”<br /><br />
And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”<br /><br />
And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.<br />
