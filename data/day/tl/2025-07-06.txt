<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“As you go, proclaim that the Kingdom of heaven is at hand”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      [The young] Francis devoutly attended Mass in honor of the apostles; the Gospel was that in which Christ sends his disciples to preach and teaches them the evangelical way of life: “no gold or silver, no copper in your belts, no travel bag, no extra tunic, no sandals, no staff.” As soon as he understood and retained this text, he fell in love with this apostolic poverty and exclaimed, transported with joy: “This is what I want! This is what my whole soul desires!” And without delay, he took off his shoes, dropped his walking staff, abandoned his bag and money as objects of horror, kept only one tunic, threw away his belt, replacing it with a rope: he put his whole heart into realizing what he had just heard and conforming in everything to this code of perfection given to the apostles.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      An impulse communicated by God thenceforth pushed him to the conquest of evangelical perfection and to a campaign of penance. When he spoke (...), his words were entirely imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit: they penetrated to the deepest parts of hearts and plunged his listeners into stupefaction. All his preaching was an announcement of peace, and he began each of his sermons with this salutation to the people: “May the Lord give you peace!” It was a revelation from the Lord, he declared later, who had taught him this formula. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      People spoke more and more about the man of God, his simple teaching, his life, and some, following his example, were seized by this spirit of penance, then joined him, leaving everything, and dressed like him, began to share his life.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">44:18-21, 23b-29; 45:1-5.</font>@@@@@In those days, Judah and his brothers, Jacob’s sons, had been brought back before Joseph. Judah approached him and said: “Please, my lord, allow your servant to speak a word to you without your anger, my lord, flaring against your servant, for you are as great as Pharaoh! <br /><br />
My lord had asked his servants: “Do you still have your father or another brother?”<br /><br />
And we replied to my lord: “We still have our old father and a young brother, the child he had in his old age; this one had a brother who died, so he remains the only child of his mother, and our father loves him!”<br /><br />
Then you said to your servants: “Bring him to me: I want to take care of him.”<br /><br />
If your youngest brother does not return with you, you will no longer be admitted into my presence.”<br /><br />
So, when we returned to our father, your servant, we reported your words, my lord, to him.<br /><br />
And, when our father said: “Go back to buy us some food,”<br /><br />
we replied to him: “We cannot go back if our youngest brother is not with us, for we will not be admitted into the presence of that man if our youngest brother is not with us.”<br /><br />
Then our father, your servant, said to us: “You well know that my wife Rachel bore me only two sons.<br /><br />
The first disappeared. Surely, a wild beast tore him to pieces, and I have never seen him again.<br /><br />
If you take this one away from me as well and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hairs down to the abode of the dead in sorrow.”<br /><br />
Joseph could no longer control himself before all the people in his retinue, and he cried out: “Make everyone go out.” When there was no one left with him, he made himself known to his brothers.<br /><br />
He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and even Pharaoh’s household.<br /><br />
He said to his brothers: “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?” But his brothers were unable to answer him, so distraught were they to find themselves before him.<br /><br />
Then Joseph said to his brothers: “Come closer to me.” They approached, and he said to them: “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold to be taken to Egypt.<br /><br />
But now do not grieve, and do not be distressed that you sold me, for it was to preserve your lives that God sent me here before you.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">105(104):16-17, 18-19, 20-21.</font>@@@@@God called a famine upon the land, <br /><br />
depriving it of all resources.<br /><br />
But before them he sent a man, <br /><br />
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They put his feet in shackles, <br /><br />
they put an iron collar around his neck;<br /><br />
he suffered for the word of the Lord, <br /><br />
until the day his prediction was fulfilled.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The king ordered him to be released, <br /><br />
the ruler of peoples, to be set free.<br /><br />
He made him master of his household, <br /><br />
and ruler over all his possessions.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10:7-15.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his Apostles: “As you go, proclaim that the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.<br /><br />
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You have received freely; give freely.”<br /><br />
Do not get gold or silver or copper coins to put into your belts,<br /><br />
no bag for the journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for the laborer deserves his food.<br /><br />
And whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart.<br /><br />
As you enter the house, greet those in it.<br /><br />
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.”<br /><br />
And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.<br /><br />
Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.”<br />
