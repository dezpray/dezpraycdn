<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Man connected to God permeates the whole world</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Man, in the structure of the world, is, so to speak, at its center. He has more power than other creatures, which nonetheless remain within the same structure. For if he is small in stature, he is great by the energies of his soul.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            With head raised and feet firmly planted, he is capable of moving elements from above as well as from below. The works of his hands penetrate everything because, by the energy of the inner man, he has the possibility to put this power into action. The body is larger than the heart, but the energies of the soul surpass those of the body in power. The heart is hidden deep within the body, but the body is surrounded by the energies of the soul, which extend to the whole world. Thus, it is through the knowledge of God, the consciousness connected to God, that the faithful exist; they strive towards God amidst the constraints of the spirit of the age. In all their undertakings, prosperous or adverse, it is towards God that they aspire. In these, they never cease to manifest to God all the loving respect that animates them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            The inner man contemplates the creatures around him with his eyes of flesh, but by faith, it is God whom he sees. Man recognizes Him in every creature, for he perceives their Creator.<br />

Book of Isaiah <font dir="ltr">66:10-14abc.</font>@@@@@Rejoice with Jerusalem! Exult in her, all you who love her! Be full of joy with her, all you who mourned for her!<br /><br />
Then you will be fed from her breasts, satisfied with her consolations; then you will delight in the abundance of her glory.<br /><br />
For the Lord declares: “Behold, I will direct peace toward her like a river, and like an overflowing torrent, the glory of the nations.” You will be nursed, carried on the hip; you will be cherished on her knees.<br /><br />
As a child whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you. Yes, in Jerusalem, you will be comforted.<br /><br />
You will see, your heart will be in joy;<br /><br />
and your bones will flourish like the green grass.<br /><br />
The Lord will make His power known to His servants.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">66(65):1-3a, 4-5, 6-7a, 16, 20.</font>@@@@@Shout for joy to God, all the earth;<br /><br />
celebrate the glory of His name, <br /><br />
glorify Him by praising Him.<br /><br />
Say to God: “How awesome are your deeds!”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All the earth bows down before you, <br /><br />
it sings to you, it sings to your name.<br /><br />
Come and see the great deeds of God, <br /><br />
His fearsome exploits for the sons of men.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He changed the sea into dry land: <br /><br />
they crossed the river on dry ground. <br /><br />
From there, this joy He gives us.<br /><br />
He reigns forever by His power.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, listen, all you who fear God: <br /><br />
I will tell you what He has done for my soul;<br /><br />
Blessed be God <br /><br />
who has not rejected my prayer, <br /><br />
nor withheld His love from me!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">10:1-12, 17-20.</font>@@@@@At that time, among the disciples, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.<br /><br />
He said to them, “The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. So ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.<br /><br />
Go! Behold, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.<br /><br />
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one on the way.<br /><br />
But whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’<br /><br />
And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.<br /><br />
Remain in the same house, eating and drinking what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from house to house.<br /><br />
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you,<br /><br />
heal the sick in it and say to them, “The kingdom of God is at hand for you.”<br /><br />
But whatever town you enter and they do not welcome you, go into its streets and say,<br /><br />
“Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless, know this: the kingdom of God is at hand.”<br /><br />
I tell you, on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.”<br /><br />
The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning.<br /><br />
Behold, I have given you the power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will harm you.<br /><br />
Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Galatians <font dir="ltr">6:14-18.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters, as for me, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<br /><br />
For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.<br /><br />
And for all who walk according to this rule—peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.<br /><br />
From now on, let no one trouble me, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.<br /><br />
Brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<br />
