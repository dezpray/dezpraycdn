<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Strive to enter through the narrow gate” (Lk 13:24)</font><br />
            We can have nothing stable in a world where we have come only to pass through, and for us, to live is each day to leave life and pass on. (…) 

            This mutability, man experiences not only in his body, but in his soul too, when he strives to raise himself towards the better. For under the weight of its mutability, the soul is ceaselessly carried towards something other than what it is, and if it is not held in its original state by the strict discipline of vigilance, it constantly slips towards the worse. For by abandoning Him who remains ceaselessly, it has lost the stability it could have kept. Thus, now its effort towards the better is merely an ascent against the current. And should it relax its intention to ascend, it is effortlessly pulled back towards the depths.

            Yes, to ascend is effort and to descend is relaxation, and it is through the narrow gate that we shall enter, as the Lord reminds us&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Strive with all your efforts,&amp;nbsp;” He says, “&amp;nbsp;to enter through the narrow gate.&amp;nbsp;” (Lk 13:24) At the moment He is about to speak of entering through the narrow gate, He first explicitly says&amp;nbsp;: “&amp;nbsp;Strive with all your efforts,&amp;nbsp;” for without fervent contention of the spirit, the current of this world, which ceaselessly pulls the soul back towards baseness, is invincible.

Book of Isaiah <font dir="ltr">66:18-21.</font><br /><br />Thus says the Lord:<br /><br />knowing their deeds and their thoughts, I am coming to gather all nations, of every tongue. They shall come and see my glory:<br /><br />I will set a sign among them! And from among them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, and Javan, to the distant islands that have heard nothing of my fame, who have not seen my glory; my glory, these survivors will proclaim among the nations.<br /><br />And from all the nations they shall bring all your brothers, as an offering to the Lord, on horses and in chariots, in litters, on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain, to Jerusalem, – says the Lord. They shall be brought as the offering that the sons of Israel bring, in clean vessels, to the House of the Lord.<br /><br />I will even take some of them as priests and Levites, – says the Lord.<br />
Psalm <font dir="ltr">117(116):1-2.</font><br /><br />Praise the Lord, all you nations; <br /><br />glorify him, all you peoples!<br /><br />
<br /><br />For his love for us has proved most strong; <br /><br />and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever!<br />
Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">13:22-30.</font><br /><br />At that time, as he made his way to Jerusalem, Jesus was passing through towns and villages, teaching.<br /><br />Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few people be saved?” He said to them:<br /><br />“Strive to enter through the narrow gate; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.<br /><br />When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then in reply he will say to you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’<br /><br />Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’<br /><br />But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from; go away from me, all you evildoers!’<br /><br />There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrown out.<br /><br />Then people will come from east and west, from north and south, and will take their place at the table in the kingdom of God.<br /><br />Indeed, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”<br />
St Bartholomew, Apostle and Martyr († c. 71 AD)
Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">12:5-7, 11-13.</font><br /><br />Brothers, you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children: ‘My child, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, or lose heart when you are punished by him.<br /><br />For the Lord disciplines those whom he loves, and chastises every child whom he accepts.’<br /><br />Endure trials for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as children; for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline?<br /><br />Now, discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.<br /><br />Therefore, strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees,<br /><br />and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.<br />
