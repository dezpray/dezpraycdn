<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Behold My Servant"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
     The mystery of our salvation is so vast, so profound, so admirable that even the angels strongly long to understand it (1 Pet 1:12)... Just as Christ was God in His nature, the true Word of God the Father (Jn 1:1), of the same nature as the Father and co-eternal with Him, and as He shone in the height of His glory "in the form and likeness of God," "He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant" and being born of holy Mary. "And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross" (Phil 2:6-8).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      He humbles Himself to our lowliness, He who gives all people His own fullness. He humbles Himself for us, not by compulsion, but of His own free will. For us, He takes the condition of a slave, He who was freedom in person. He becomes one of us, He who was exalted above all creation. He submits to death, He who gives life to the world... He becomes, like us, subject to the Law (Gal 4:4), He who, as God, transcends the Law. He becomes a man among others, subject to birth. He takes on a beginning, He who precedes all centuries and all ages: indeed, He who is the Creator and the origin of time... He who took flesh from Mary... is of the same nature as us, is made of our very substance, taking upon Himself the offspring of Abraham. But, at the same time, on the divine plane, He is of the same nature as God His Father.  <br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">12:37-42.</font>@@@@@In those days, the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, not counting the children.<br /><br />
A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very many flocks and herds.<br /><br />
They baked unleavened cakes from the dough they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.<br /><br />
The sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.<br /><br />
And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
It was a night of vigil for the Lord, when He brought the children of Israel out of Egypt; therefore, it must be for them, from generation to generation, a night of vigil in honor of the Lord.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">136(135):1, 23-24, 10-12, 13-15.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
He remembered us in our low estate,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
and delivered us from the hand of our oppressors,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
and brought Israel out from among them,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
with a strong hand and an outstretched arm,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
who divided the Red Sea into parts,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
and made Israel pass through the midst of it,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br /><br />
but cast Pharaoh and his armies into the Red Sea,<br /><br />
for his steadfast love endures forever!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">12:14-21.</font>@@@@@At that time, once outside the synagogue, the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, how to destroy him.<br /><br />
Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there; many people followed him, and he healed them all.<br /><br />
But he strictly ordered them not to make him known.<br /><br />
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:<br /><br />
“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.<br /><br />
He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.<br /><br />
He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick, until he brings justice to victory.<br /><br />
And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”<br />
