<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Among those who are here, some will not taste death before they have seen the kingdom of God »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
    Our Lord Jesus Christ led Peter, James, and John up the mountain to show them the glory of His divinity and to make known to them that He was the Redeemer of Israel, as He had shown through the prophets. He also wished to prevent them from being scandalized by the sight of the freely consented sufferings He was about to endure for us in His human nature. Indeed, they knew Him as man, but they were unaware that He was God; they knew Him as the son of Mary, a man dwelling with them in the world, but on the mountain He made known to them that He was the Son of God, and God Himself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    They had seen Him eat and drink, work and rest, grow weary and sleep, undergo dread even to drops of sweat—all things that hardly seemed in harmony with His divine nature and appeared suited only to His humanity. That is why He led them up the mountain, so that the Father might call Him His Son and show them that He was truly His Son and that He was God. He led them up the mountain and showed them His Kingdom before manifesting His sufferings, His power before His death, His glory before the insults, and His honor before the ignominy. Thus, when He would be seized and crucified, His apostles would know that it was not by weakness but by consent and of His own free will, for the salvation of the world.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">7:9-10, 13-14.</font>@@@@@As I looked on, in my vision by night, I, Daniel, saw: thrones were set in place, and an Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, with wheels of burning fire.<br /><br />
A river of fire streamed forth and issued from before him. Thousands upon thousands served him, and myriads upon myriads stood before him. The court convened, and books were opened.<br /><br />
As I looked on in the night visions, I saw coming with the clouds of heaven, one like a son of man; he came up to the Ancient of Days, and was presented before him.<br /><br />
And to him was given dominion, glory, and kingship; all peoples, nations, and languages served him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingship, one that shall not be destroyed.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">97 (96):1-2, 4-5, 6, 9.</font>@@@@@The Lord is king! Let the earth rejoice! <br /><br />
Let the countless islands be glad!<br /><br />
Clouds and thick darkness surround him, <br /><br />
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
His lightnings illumine the world;<br /><br />
the earth sees and trembles.<br /><br />
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,<br /><br />
before the Lord of all the earth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The heavens proclaim his righteousness,<br /><br />
and all peoples have seen his glory.<br /><br />
You, O Lord, are the Most High over all the earth:<br /><br />
you are exalted far above all gods.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9:28b-36.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.<br /><br />
And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.<br /><br />
And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,<br /><br />
who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.<br /><br />
Now Peter and his companions were heavy with sleep, but when they woke up, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.<br /><br />
And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said.<br /><br />
As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.<br /><br />
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!”<br /><br />
And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one anything of what they had seen.<br />
