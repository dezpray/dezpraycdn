<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The Father is He from whom all that exists comes. He Himself, in Christ and through Christ, is the origin of all. Furthermore, He is His own being in Himself, and does not receive what He is from elsewhere... He is infinite because He is not in any place, but everything is in Him... He is always before time; time comes from Him. If your thought pursues Him and if you believe you can reach the limits of His being, you will always find Him, for as you ceaselessly advance towards Him, the goal towards which you move is always further away... Such is the truth of the mystery of God, such is the expression of the incomprehensible nature of the Father... To express Him, speech can only be silent; to probe Him, thought remains inert; and to grasp Him, intelligence feels constrained.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      And yet, this name of Father indicates His nature: He is only Father. For He does not receive the fact of being Father from elsewhere, in the manner of men. He is the Eternal Unbegotten... He is known only by the Son, since “no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him,” and “no one knows the Son except the Father.” Both know each other, and this mutual knowledge is perfect. Therefore, since “no one knows the Father except the Son,” let us have no other thought of the Father than that which the Son, who alone is “the faithful witness” (Rev 1:5), has revealed to us.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      It is better to think about what concerns the Father than to speak of Him. For every word is powerless to express His perfections... We can only acknowledge His glory, have a certain idea of it, and try to clarify it through our imagination. But human language feels its powerlessness, and words do not explain reality as it is... Thus, however much one may acknowledge God, one must refrain from naming Him: whatever words are used, they could not express God as He is, nor convey His greatness... We must believe in Him, try to understand Him, and adore Him; in doing so, we will speak of Him.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3:1-6, 9-12.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock beyond the desert and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord appeared to him in the flame of a bush that was on fire. Moses looked: the bush was burning without being consumed.<br /><br />
Then Moses said to himself, “I will turn aside to see this extraordinary sight: why does the bush not burn up?”<br /><br />
When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush, “Moses! Moses!” He answered, “Here I am!”<br /><br />
Then God said, “Do not come near! Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground!”<br /><br />
And he declared, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses veiled his face, for he was afraid to look at God.<br /><br />
The Lord said: “Now the cry of the sons of Israel has reached me, and I have seen the oppression that the Egyptians inflict upon them.<br /><br />
Now therefore, go! I send you to Pharaoh: you shall bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.”<br /><br />
Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”<br /><br />
God answered him, “I am with you. And this is the sign that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought my people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">103(102):1-2, 3-4, 6-7.</font>@@@@@Bless the Lord, O my soul, <br /><br />
and all that is within me, bless his holy name!<br /><br />
Bless the Lord, O my soul, <br /><br />
and forget not all his benefits!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He forgives all your iniquity, <br /><br />
he heals all your diseases;<br /><br />
he redeems your life from the pit, <br /><br />
he crowns you with steadfast love and mercy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord works righteousness, <br /><br />
and justice for all who are oppressed.<br /><br />
He made known his ways to Moses, <br /><br />
his acts to the children of Israel.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11:25-27.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus spoke out and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and have revealed them to little ones.<br /><br />
Yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.<br /><br />
All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”<br />
