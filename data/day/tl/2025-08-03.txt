<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Consider the original equality of the human family!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            When men amass gold, silver, sumptuous and useless garments, diamonds, and other such things that give rise to war, discord, and tyranny, they are seized by a mad arrogance, close their hearts to the misfortunes of their brethren, and do not even consent to let them have of their superfluity to provide them with a living. Stupid aberration&amp;nbsp;!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            They do not realize at all that poverty and wealth, free condition – as we say – and servile condition, as well as other similar categories, arrived late among men and surged like epidemics along with sin, of which they were the consequences. “&amp;nbsp;But it was not this way from the beginning&amp;nbsp;” (Mt 19:8). In the beginning, the Creator left man free and master of himself, bound by a single commandment and rich in the delights of paradise. God desired this for all humankind, descended from the first man. Freedom and wealth depended on the observance of a single commandment. Its violation led to true poverty and servitude.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Since envy and disputes appeared with the cunning tyranny of the serpent, who seduces us through pleasure and pits the bolder against the weaker, the human family has been torn apart into nations foreign to one another. Avarice has supplanted natural generosity and relied on law to dominate by force.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            But you, consider primitive equality and not subsequent divisions, the law of the Creator and not that of the powerful. Help nature to the best of your ability, honor original liberty, respect your person, protect your race from dishonor, assist it in its illnesses, comfort it in its poverty. Seek to distinguish yourself from others only by your goodness. Become God for the unfortunate by imitating divine mercy.<br />

Book of Ecclesiastes <font dir="ltr">1:2; 2:21-23.</font>@@@@@Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth. Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
A man toiled; he was wise, he had knowledge, he succeeded. And behold, he must leave his possessions to someone who has not toiled at all. This too is only vanity, it is a great evil!&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
Indeed, what remains for a man from all the toil and all the calculations for which he labors under the sun?&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
All his days are full of suffering, his occupations are full of torment&amp;nbsp;: even at night, his heart finds no rest. This too is only vanity.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">90(89):3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 14, 17ab.</font>@@@@@You make man return to dust&amp;nbsp;;<br /><br />
You said: “Return, O children of Adam!&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
In your eyes, a thousand years are like yesterday,&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
like a day that is gone, an hour in the night.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You sweep them away: they are like a dream&amp;nbsp;; <br /><br />
at morning, they are like grass that changes&amp;nbsp;:<br /><br />
it flourishes in the morning, it changes&amp;nbsp;; <br /><br />
in the evening, it is withered, dried up.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Teach us the true measure of our days&amp;nbsp;: <br /><br />
that our hearts may gain wisdom.<br /><br />
Return, O Lord, why delay&amp;nbsp;? <br /><br />
Relent, out of regard for your servants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Satisfy us with your love in the morning,&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
that we may spend our days in joy and songs.<br /><br />
May the favor of the Lord our God be upon us!&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />
Confirm for us the work of our hands.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12:13-21.</font>@@@@@At that time, from the midst of the crowd, someone asked Jesus, “Teacher, tell my brother to share our inheritance with me.”<br /><br />
Jesus replied to him, “Man, who appointed me to be your judge or arbiter of your divisions?”<br /><br />
Then, addressing everyone, he said, “Beware of all covetousness, for one’s life, even in abundance, does not depend on what he possesses.”<br /><br />
And he told them this parable: “There was a rich man whose land had yielded a good harvest.<br /><br />
He wondered, “What shall I do? For I have nowhere to store my harvest.”<br /><br />
Then he said, “This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and all my goods.<br /><br />
And I will say to myself, ‘You have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease; eat, drink, be merry.’”<br /><br />
But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded of you. And what you have accumulated, whose will it be?’”<br /><br />
“So it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself, but is not rich toward God.”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">3:1-5, 9-11.</font>@@@@@Brothers, if you have been raised with Christ, seek what is above&amp;nbsp;: there is Christ, seated at the right hand of God.<br /><br />
Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.<br /><br />
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br /><br />
When Christ appears, your life, then you too will appear with him in glory.<br /><br />
Therefore, put to death what is earthly in you&amp;nbsp;: immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.<br /><br />
No more lying among yourselves&amp;nbsp;: you have rid yourselves of the old self and its practices,<br /><br />
and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator,<br /><br />
Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free&amp;nbsp;; but Christ is all, and in all.<br />
