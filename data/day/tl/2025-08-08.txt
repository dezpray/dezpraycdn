<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">If only we knew the worth of our soul!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            My brethren, if only we knew the worth of our soul, with what care would we not preserve it? Alas! we shall never comprehend it enough! To wish, my brethren, to show you the immensity of the worth of a soul: this is impossible for a mortal; only God alone knows all the beauties, the perfections with which He adorns a soul.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            I will tell you only that all that God has created: heaven, earth, and all they contain, all these wonders are created in its favour. (…) This soul has, like God, the power to know, to love, and to determine itself freely in all its actions. Behold, my brethren, the finest praise we can offer for the qualities with which God has beautified our soul, created by the three Persons of the Holy Trinity and in their likeness. A spirit, like God, eternal for the future, capable of knowing the beauties and all the perfections of God as much as is possible for a creature; a soul, which is the object of the delight of the three Divine Persons; a soul, which can glorify God in all its actions; a soul, whose entire occupation will be to sing the praises of God through days without end; a soul, which will be radiant with the very happiness of God; a soul which has such freedom in all its actions that it can give its friendship, its love to whomsoever it pleases. (…)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Let us say all in a single word, my brethren: our soul is something so great, so precious, that only God alone surpasses it.<br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">4:32-40.</font>@@@@@Moses spoke to the people of Israel: <br /><br />
“Inquire now about the days of old, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth: from one end of heaven to the other, has anything so great ever occurred, or has anything like it ever been heard of?<br /><br />
Has any people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire, as you have heard, and remained alive?<br /><br />
Has any god ever undertaken to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by terrifying deeds – as you saw the Lord your God do for you in Egypt?<br /><br />
To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord alone is God; there is no other besides him.<br /><br />
Out of heaven he made you hear his voice to instruct you; and on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.<br /><br />
Because he loved your fathers and chose their descendants, he himself brought you out of Egypt by his great strength,<br /><br />
to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you into their land and to give it to you as an inheritance, as it is to this day.<br /><br />
Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that the Lord alone is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.<br /><br />
Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may have long life in the land that the Lord your God is giving you forever.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">77(76):12-13, 14-15, 16, 21.</font>@@@@@I recall the deeds of the Lord; <br /><br />
I remember your wonders of old;<br /><br />
I muse on all your mighty deeds, <br /><br />
and on your exploits I meditate.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O God, your way is holy! <br /><br />
What god is as great as God?<br /><br />
You are the God who works wonders, <br /><br />
who makes known among the peoples your strength.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You redeemed your people with power, <br /><br />
the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.<br /><br />
You led your people like a flock <br /><br />
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">16:24-28.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.<br /><br />
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.<br /><br />
What profit, indeed, will a man have if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life?<br /><br />
For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father; and then he will repay each according to his conduct.”<br /><br />
Truly, I say to you: among those standing here, there are some who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”<br />
