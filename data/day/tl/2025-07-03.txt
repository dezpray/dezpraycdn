Blessed is he who is visited by the Word!

<br />
“Bear with me in a little foolishness” (2 Cor 11:1). I confess – and I say this in all simplicity – that the Word has visited me, and very often. But although He has frequently entered into me, I have never, at any time, felt the moment of His coming. I felt that He was present; I remember that He was with me; I have sometimes even been able to foresee that He would come; but I have never felt His coming or His departure. How did He come or leave? I do not know.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is not through the eyes that He enters, for He has neither form nor color that we can discern; it is not through the ears, for His coming produces no sound; nor can His presence be recognized by touch, for He is intangible. By what way, then, did He come? Must we believe that He did not enter at all since He does not come from outside? He is not, in fact, among external things. But on the other hand, He could not come from within me, since He is good and in me, I know, there is nothing good.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I ascended to the peak of myself, and I saw that the Word resided even higher. Exploring curiously, I descended to the lowest depths of my being, and He was even lower. When I turned my gaze outward, I discovered that He was beyond all that is external to me; then I turned inward, and He was even deeper within. I finally recognized the truth of these words that I had read in Scripture: “In Him we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Blessed is he in whom the Word is, who lives for Him and is moved by Him!

Song of Songs 3:1-4a.

Words of the Beloved.

Upon my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not.<br /><br />
“I will rise now and go about the city, through the streets and through the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves.” I sought him, but found him not.<br /><br />
The watchmen found me as they went about the city. “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”<br /><br />
Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go.

Psalm 63:2-9.

O God, you are my God;

earnestly I seek you;

my soul thirsts for you;

my flesh faints for you,

as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.<br /><br />

So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,

beholding your power and glory.

Because your steadfast love is better than life,

my lips will praise you.<br /><br />

So I will bless you as long as I live;

in your name I will lift up my hands.

My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,

and my mouth will praise you with exultant lips.<br /><br />

For you have been my help,

and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.

My soul clings to you;

your right hand upholds me.

The Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John 20:1, 11-18.

On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.<br /><br />
But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb;<br /><br />
and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet.<br /><br />
They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”<br /><br />
When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher).<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”<br /><br />
Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” and she told them what he had said to her.
