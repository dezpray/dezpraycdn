<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Carry the news of my resurrection to those who have not seen me!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      “&amp;nbsp;Put your finger in the mark of the nails,&amp;nbsp;” Jesus said to Thomas. “&amp;nbsp;You were looking for me when I was not here; take advantage now. I know your desire despite your silence. Before you tell me, I know what you are thinking. I heard you speak, and though invisible, I was near you, near your doubts, and without revealing myself, I made you wait, the better to observe your impatience. Put your finger in the mark of the nails. Put your hand in my side, and be no longer incredulous, but believe.&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Then Thomas touches Him:&amp;nbsp;all his distrust falls away, and filled with sincere faith and all the love owed to his God, he cries out:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;My Lord and my God!&amp;nbsp;” And the Lord said to him:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Because you have seen me, you have believed;&amp;nbsp;blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed! Thomas, carry the news of my resurrection to those who have not seen me. Lead all the earth to believe not by their eyes, but by your word. Journey through the peoples and pagan cities. Teach them to carry the cross on their shoulders instead of weapons... Tell them they are called by grace, and you, contemplate their faith:&amp;nbsp;blessed, indeed, are those who have not seen and have believed!&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Such is the army the Lord raises;&amp;nbsp;such are the children of the baptismal font, the works of grace, the harvest of the Spirit. They have followed Christ without having seen Him; they sought Him and they believed. They recognized with the eyes of faith, not of the body. They did not put their fingers in the marks of the nails, but they attached themselves to His cross and embraced His sufferings. They did not see the Lord&#039;s side, but by grace they united themselves to His members and made their own this word of the Lord:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed!&amp;nbsp;”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians <font dir="ltr">2:19-22.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,<br /><br />
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.<br /><br />
In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord;<br /><br />
in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Holy Spirit.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">20:24-29.</font>@@@@@Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called Didymus (which means Twin), was not with them when Jesus came.<br /><br />
The other disciples told him:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;We have seen the Lord!&amp;nbsp;” But he declared to them:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe!&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Peace be with you.&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
Then he said to Thomas:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
Thomas answered him,&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;My Lord and my God!&amp;nbsp;”<br /><br />
Jesus said to him:&amp;nbsp;“&amp;nbsp;Because you have seen me, you believe. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&amp;nbsp;”<br />
