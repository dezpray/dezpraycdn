    Lord God, You who have filled us with everything, grant us peace (Is 26:12), the peace of rest, the peace of the Sabbath, the Sabbath that has no evening. For this beautiful order of things that You have created and which are "very good" (Gn 1:31) will pass when it has reached the end of its destiny. Yes, they had their morning, they will have their evening. But the seventh day has no evening, no sunset, since You have sanctified it to last forever. At the end of Your "very good" works, which You nevertheless accomplished in rest, You rested on the seventh day; this is to tell us through Your book that at the end of our works, which are very good because it is You who gave them to us (Is 26:12), we too will rest in You on the Sabbath of eternal life. Then You will rest in us just as today You act in us; thus, this rest that we will enjoy will be Yours, just as the works we do are Yours.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    You, Lord, are always at work and are always at rest... For us, there comes a moment when we are moved to act for good, after our heart has conceived it from Your Spirit, whereas before we were moved to do evil when we abandoned You. You, uniquely good God, have never ceased to do good. Some of our works are good, by Your grace it is true, but they are not eternal; after them, we hope to rest in Your ineffable sanctification. But You, Goodness who need no other good, You are always at rest, because Your rest is Yourself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    Who among men can give understanding of all this to man? What angel will give it to angels? What angel to man? It is from You that it must be asked, in You that it must be sought, at Your door that one must knock. And thus, yes, thus one will receive, thus one will find, thus the door will be opened (Mt 7:8).<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">11:10, 12:1-14.</font><br />
In those days, Moses and Aaron had performed all sorts of wonders before Pharaoh; but the LORD had made Pharaoh obstinate, and he would not let the Israelites leave his country.<br /><br />
While in the land of Egypt, the LORD said to Moses and his brother Aaron:<br /><br />
"This month shall be for you the first of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you.<br /><br />
Speak to all the community of Israel: On the tenth of this month, every man shall take a lamb for his family, a lamb for each household.<br /><br />
If the household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall take one together with its closest neighbor, according to the number of persons. You shall choose the lamb according to what each can eat.<br /><br />
It shall be a lamb without blemish, a year-old male. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.<br /><br />
You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month. Then, with the whole assembly of the community of Israel, it shall be slaughtered at twilight.<br /><br />
They shall take some of its blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses where they eat it.<br /><br />
They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br /><br />
You shall not eat any of it raw or boiled, but roasted over the fire, with its head, shanks, and inner organs.<br /><br />
You shall not let any of it remain until morning; whatever is left over in the morning you shall burn.<br /><br />
This is how you are to eat it: with your loins girt, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You shall eat it in haste; it is the Passover of the LORD.<br /><br />
For on that same night I will pass through the land of Egypt, striking down every firstborn in the land, both man and beast, and executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt: I am the LORD.<br /><br />
The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you; no destructive plague will touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
This day shall be a memorial for you. You shall celebrate it as a feast of pilgrimage to the LORD. It is a perpetual decree: throughout your generations you shall celebrate it."<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">116 (115):12-13, 15-16ac, 17-18.</font><br />
How can I repay the LORD <br /><br />
for all his goodness to me?<br /><br />
I will raise the cup of salvation <br /><br />
and call on the name of the LORD.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Precious in the sight of the LORD <br /><br />
is the death of his faithful ones.<br /><br />
Am I not, LORD, your servant,<br /><br />
I, whose bonds you have loosed?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving <br /><br />
and call on the name of the LORD.<br /><br />
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD, <br /><br />
yes, before all his people.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">12:1-8.</font><br />
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath; and his disciples became hungry and began to pick heads of grain and eat them.<br /><br />
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath!"<br /><br />
He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he and his companions became hungry?<br /><br />
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.<br /><br />
Or have you not read in the Law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless?<br /><br />
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.<br /><br />
But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,'<br /><br />
you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."<br />
