Book of Numbers <font dir="ltr">20:1-13.</font>@@@@@In the first month, the whole community of the Israelites arrived in the Desert of Zin. The people settled in Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried.<br /><br />
Since there was no water for the community, they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.<br /><br />
The people quarreled with Moses, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the Lord!<br /><br />
Why have you brought the assembly of the Lord into this desert for us and our livestock to die here?<br /><br />
Why did you make us come up from Egypt and bring us to this wretched place, where nothing can be sown, where there are no figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and not even water to drink!"<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron left the assembly and went to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.<br /><br />
The Lord spoke to Moses. He said:<br /><br />
"Take your staff and, with your brother Aaron, gather the community. Then, before their eyes, you will speak to the rock, and it will pour out its water. For them, you will make water gush from the rock, and you will give the community and their livestock to drink."<br /><br />
As he had been commanded, Moses took the staff from before the Lord.<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, "Listen now, you rebels! Can we bring water out of this rock for you?"<br /><br />
Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out in abundance, and the community was able to drink and water their livestock.<br /><br />
The Lord then said to Moses and his brother Aaron, "Because you did not have enough faith to manifest my holiness before the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land I am giving them."<br /><br />
These are the waters of Meribah (that is: the waters of Contention) where the Israelites contended with the Lord, and where the Lord manifested his holiness among them.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">95(94):1-2, 6-7ab, 7d-9a.</font>@@@@@Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord, <br /><br />
let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation!<br /><br />
Let us come before him with thanksgiving, <br /><br />
and extol him with music and song!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, let us bow down in worship, <br /><br />
let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br /><br />
For he is our God;<br /><br />
we are the people of his pasture.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Today, if only you would hear his voice:<br /><br />
"Do not harden your hearts as you did in the wilderness, <br /><br />
as you did on the day of testing and rebellion,<br /><br />
where your ancestors tested and tried me."<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">16:13-23.</font>@@@@@At that time, when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"<br /><br />
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."<br /><br />
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"<br /><br />
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<br /><br />
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.<br /><br />
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.<br /><br />
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."<br /><br />
Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.<br /><br />
From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.<br /><br />
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you."<br /><br />
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."<br />
