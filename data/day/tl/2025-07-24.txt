<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear”</font><font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      A felled tree, even if cut down at its base, grows back and re-blooms; and a felled man will not live again? The harvested seeds rest, sleep in granaries and revive in spring; and the harvested man, thrown into the granaries of death, will not live again? A vine bud, a cut and transplanted branch, revive and bear fruit; and man, for whom all was created, once fallen will not be able to rise again?...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     Therefore, contemplate what is happening around you. Meditate on the tableau of this vast universe. I sow wheat or any other seed; it falls and dies, it rots and can no longer serve as food for man. But from its decay it is reborn, it rises, it multiplies. Now, for whom was it created? Is it not for our use? It is not for themselves that all these seeds came out of nothingness. So what was created for us dies and is reborn, and we, for whom this wonder operates every day, our death would be without awakening?<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">19:1-2, 9-11, 16-20ab.</font><br />On the third month after the departure from Egypt, to the day, the sons of Israel arrived in the desert of Sinai.<br /><br />
It was from Rephidim that they set out and entered this desert, and they encamped there just in front of the mountain.<br /><br />
The LORD said to Moses, “I am coming to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may forever believe you.” Then Moses reported the people’s words to the LORD.<br /><br />
The LORD also said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes,<br /><br />
so that they may be ready for the third day, for on the third day, in the sight of all the people, the LORD will descend on Mount Sinai.”<br /><br />
On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.<br /><br />
Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the LORD had descended upon it in fire. The smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled violently.<br /><br />
As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of God answered him.<br /><br />
The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai,<br /><br />
and called Moses to the top of the mountain.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">3:52, 53, 54, 55, 56.</font><br />Blessed are you, Lord, God of our fathers:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed be the most holy name of your glory:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you in your holy temple of glory:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you, who plumb the depths:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You who sit above the Cherubim:<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you in the firmament, in heaven,<br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:10-17.</font><br />At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”<br /><br />
He answered, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.<br /><br />
For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br /><br />
This is why I speak to them in parables: because looking they do not see, and hearing they do not listen or understand.<br /><br />
Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: ‘You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.<br /><br />
For this people’s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.’<br /><br />
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear!<br /><br />
Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.”<br />
