<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">To love with God’s very own love!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            [Saint Catherine heard God say to her:] Know this well: all imperfection or all perfection in love manifests itself and is acquired in relation to Me, and likewise in relation to one’s neighbor. Simple souls, who often love creatures with a spiritual love, know this well. If they love Me with a purified and disinterested love, it is also purely and with disinterestedness that they love their neighbor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is like a vase that is filled at a fountain. If one removes it from the source to drink, it is soon empty. But if one keeps it immersed in the source, one can always drink from it; it remains always full. Thus it is for the love of neighbor, spiritual or temporal: one must drink it in Me, without other consideration. For I ask you to love Me with the same love with which I love you.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            In truth, you would not be able to do so completely. I have loved you before being loved, and therefore, all love you have for Me is a debt you repay, not a grace you grant Me, whereas the love I have for you is a favor I bestow upon you, but which I do not owe you. You cannot, therefore, return to Me the love I demand from you. But I have placed you beside your neighbor, to allow you to do for him what you cannot do for Me: to love him by grace, and with disinterestedness, without expecting any advantage from it. I then consider what you do for your neighbor as done for Me.<br />

Book of Ruth <font dir="ltr">1:1, 3-6, 14b-16, 22.</font>@@@@@In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah emigrated with his wife and two sons to settle in the region called the Fields of Moab.<br /><br />
Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and Naomi was left alone with her two sons, Mahlon and Chilion.<br /><br />
These married two Moabite women; one was named Orpah (meaning: Turnaround) and the other, Ruth (meaning: Companion). They lived there for about ten years.<br /><br />
Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.<br /><br />
Then, with her daughters-in-law, she prepared to leave the Fields of Moab and return home, for she had heard that the Lord had visited His people and given them bread.<br /><br />
Along the way, Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and left her, but Ruth clung to her.<br /><br />
Naomi said to her, “See, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods. Return you also, as your sister-in-law has done.”<br /><br />
Ruth answered her, “Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.”<br /><br />
So Naomi returned from the Fields of Moab with her daughter-in-law, Ruth the Moabite. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">146(145):5-6, 7, 8-9a, 9bc-10.</font>@@@@@Happy is he who relies on the God of Jacob, <br /><br />
who places his hope in the Lord his God.<br /><br />
He who made heaven and earth <br /><br />
the sea and all that they contain!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He keeps His faithfulness forever,<br /><br />
He renders justice to the oppressed; <br /><br />
to the hungry, He gives bread; <br /><br />
the Lord sets the chained free.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord opens the eyes of the blind, <br /><br />
the Lord straightens the bowed down, <br /><br />
the Lord loves the just,<br /><br />
the Lord protects the stranger.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He supports the widow and the orphan,<br /><br />
He makes the path of the wicked go astray.<br /><br />
From age to age, the Lord shall reign: <br /><br />
your God, O Zion, forever!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">22:34-40.</font>@@@@@At that time, the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together,<br /><br />
and one of them, a scholar of the law, asked him a question to test him:<br /><br />
“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”<br /><br />
Jesus said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’<br /><br />
This is the great and first commandment.<br /><br />
And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’<br /><br />
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”<br />
