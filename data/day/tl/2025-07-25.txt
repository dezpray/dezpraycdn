    “It is in vain that you rise early, before the day” (Ps 127:2). What does this mean? ... Christ, our Day, has risen; it is good to rise after Christ and not before Him. Who are those who rise before Christ? ... Those who wish to be exalted here on earth, where He was humble. Let them therefore be humble in this world if they wish to be exalted where Christ is exalted. Indeed, He said of those who had adhered to Him by faith — and we are precisely among them: “Father, those whom you have given me, I desire that where I am, they also may be with me” (Jn 17:24). A magnificent gift, a great grace, a glorious promise... Do you wish to be where He is exalted? Be humble where He was humble.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    “The disciple is not above the teacher” (Mt 10:24)... And yet, the sons of Zebedee, before having undergone humiliation in conformity with the Lord’s Passion, had already chosen their place, one at His right, the other at His left. They wished to “rise before the Day”; that is why they walked in vain. The Lord recalled them to humility by asking them: “Can you drink the chalice that I am to drink? I came to be humble, and do you wish to be exalted before me? Follow me,” He said, “in the way I go. For if you wish to go by a way where I do not go, it is in vain.”<br />

Second Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians <font dir="ltr">4:7-15.</font>@@@@@Brothers, we carry a treasure in earthen vessels; thus, it is clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.<br /><br />
In every circumstance, we are distressed, but not anguished; we are perplexed, but not despairing;<br /><br />
we are persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<br /><br />
Always we carry, in our body, the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus, too, may be manifested in our body.<br /><br />
Indeed, we, the living, are continually delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus, too, may be manifested in our mortal flesh.<br /><br />
Thus death is at work in us, and life in you.<br /><br />
Scripture says: ‘I believed, therefore I spoke.’ And we too, who have the same spirit of faith, we believe, and therefore we speak.<br /><br />
For, we know, He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us too with Jesus, and will place us near Him with you.<br /><br />
And all this is for you, so that grace, more widely spread among a greater number, may make thanksgiving abound for the glory of God.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">126(125):1-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6.</font>@@@@@When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, <br /><br />
we were like dreamers!<br /><br />
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br /><br />
and our tongue with shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then it was said among the nations:<br /><br />
“The Lord has done great things for them!”<br /><br />
The Lord has done great things for us; <br /><br />
we rejoiced!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Restore our fortunes, O Lord, <br /><br />
like streams in the Negeb!<br /><br />
Those who sow in tears <br /><br />
shall reap with shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He goes out weeping, <br /><br />
bearing the seed for sowing; <br /><br />
He comes home with shouts of joy, <br /><br />
bringing his sheaves with him.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">20:20-28.</font>@@@@@At that time, the mother of James and John, sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus with her sons James and John, and she knelt down to make a request of him.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your Kingdom.”<br /><br />
Jesus replied, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We can.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “My cup you will indeed drink; but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”<br /><br />
When the ten heard this, they were indignant with the two brothers.<br /><br />
Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.<br /><br />
Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,<br /><br />
and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave—<br /><br />
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”<br />
