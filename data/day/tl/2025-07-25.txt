<font style="text-align:left" dir="ltr">“He said to them, ‘Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.’”</font>@@@@@<font style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><br />
    “It is in vain that you rise early” (Ps 126:2). What does that mean? ... Christ, our Day, has risen; it is good to rise after Christ and not before Him. Who are those who rise before Christ? ... Those who want to be exalted here on earth, where He was humble. Let them therefore be humble in this world if they want to be exalted where Christ is exalted. Indeed, He said of those who had adhered to Him by faith—and we are precisely among them: “Father, those whom you have given me, I want that where I am, they also may be with me” (Jn 17:25). Magnificent gift, great grace, glorious promise... Do you want to be where He is exalted? Be humble where He was humble.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    “A disciple is not above his teacher” (Mt 10:24)... And yet, the sons of Zebedee, before having undergone humiliation in conformity with the Lord's Passion, had already chosen their place, one at His right, the other at His left. They wanted to “rise before the Day”; that is why they walked in vain. The Lord reminded them of humility by asking them, “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? I have come to be humble, and you want to be exalted before me? Follow me,” He said, “in the way I go. For if you want to go by a way I do not go, it is in vain.”<br />

Second Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians <font dir="ltr">4:7-15.</font>@@@@@Brothers, we carry a treasure in earthen vessels; thus it is clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.<br /><br />
In every circumstance, we are distressed, but not in despair; we are perplexed, but not at a loss;<br /><br />
we are persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<br /><br />
Always we carry in our body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.<br /><br />
Indeed, we who are alive are continually being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh.<br /><br />
Thus death is at work in us, but life in you.<br /><br />
Scripture says, ‘I believed, therefore I spoke.’ And we also, who have the same spirit of faith, we believe, and therefore we speak.<br /><br />
For we know that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you in His presence.<br /><br />
And all this is for your sake, so that grace, extended to more and more people, may make thanksgiving overflow to the glory of God.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">126(125):1-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6.</font>@@@@@When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, <br /><br />
we were like those who dream!<br /><br />
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br /><br />
we uttered shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then they said among the nations,<br /><br />
“The Lord has done great things for them!”<br /><br />
The Lord has done great things for us;<br /><br />
we are overjoyed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Restore our fortunes, O Lord,<br /><br />
like streams in the desert.<br /><br />
Those who sow in tears<br /><br />
shall reap with shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He who goes out weeping,<br /><br />
bearing the seed for sowing,<br /><br />
shall come home with shouts of joy,<br /><br />
bringing his sheaves with him.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">20:20-28.</font>@@@@@At that time, the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus with her sons James and John, and she knelt down to make a request of him.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your Kingdom.”<br /><br />
Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We can.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “My cup you will indeed drink; but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”<br /><br />
When the ten heard this, they were indignant at the two brothers.<br /><br />
Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.<br /><br />
It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant,<br /><br />
and whoever would be first among you must be your slave,<br /><br />
even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”<br />
