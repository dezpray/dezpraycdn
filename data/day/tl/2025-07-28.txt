Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">32:15-24, 30-34.</font>
In those days, Moses came down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the Testimony; the tablets were written on both sides;<br /><br />
they were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on these tablets.<br /><br />
Joshua heard the noise and the clamor of the people and said to Moses, "There is the sound of battle in the camp."<br /><br />
Moses replied, "It is not the sound of shouts of victory or shouts of defeat; what I hear are songs answering each other."<br /><br />
As he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger flared up; he threw the tablets he was carrying and broke them at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
He took the calf they had made, burned it, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the surface of the water. And he made the Israelites drink this water.<br /><br />
Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such great sin upon them?"<br /><br />
Aaron replied, "Let not my lord be angry! You know this people, that they are prone to evil!<br /><br />
They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'<br /><br />
So I told them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off.' They gave it to me, I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."<br /><br />
The next day, Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."<br /><br />
So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.<br /><br />
But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written."<br /><br />
The Lord replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.<br /><br />
Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about, and my angel will go before you. But when the day comes for me to intervene, I will punish them for their sin."<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:31-35.</font>
At that time, Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.<br /><br />
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is larger than other garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make their nests in its branches."<br /><br />
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened."<br /><br />
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable,<br /><br />
so that what had been spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled: ‘I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.’<br />
