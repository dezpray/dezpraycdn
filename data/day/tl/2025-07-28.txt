<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Until all the dough had risen”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      I wish to recall the divine grandeur of faithfully fulfilling the daily, ordinary obligations, made of struggles that fill the Lord with joy and that He alone knows with each of us. Be convinced of this: you will not ordinarily have to perform dazzling feats, especially because the occasion for them does not usually arise. On the other hand, you will not lack opportunities to prove your love for Jesus Christ in small things, in what is normal...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When we meditate on the words of our Lord, "for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth" (Jn 17:19), we clearly perceive our sole goal: sanctification, in other words, our duty to be holy in order to sanctify. At the same time, the subtle temptation might assail us to think that very few of us have decided to respond to this divine invitation, not to mention that we realize we are but very ordinary instruments (cf. Lk 17:10). We are few, it is true, compared to the rest of humanity, and by ourselves, we are worth nothing. But the Master's affirmation has the accent of authority: the Christian is light, salt, leaven of the world, and "a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough" (Mt 5:13-14; Gal 5:9).<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">32:15-24, 30-34.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses came down from the mountain. He carried the two tablets of the Testimony; these tablets were written on both sides;<br /><br />
they were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on these tablets.<br /><br />
Joshua heard the noise and tumult of the people and said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp."<br /><br />
Moses replied, "These sounds are not the sound of victory or the sound of defeat; what I hear are songs answering each other."<br /><br />
As he approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. He became enraged, threw the tablets he carried, and broke them at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
He seized the calf they had made, burned it, ground it to powder, which he scattered on the surface of the water. And he made the sons of Israel drink that water.<br /><br />
Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"<br /><br />
Aaron replied, "Let not my lord be angry! You know well that this people is prone to evil!"<br /><br />
"It was they who said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. For this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'"<br /><br />
"I said to them, 'Whoever among you has gold, let them strip themselves of it.' They gave it to me, I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."<br /><br />
The next day, Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the Lord. Perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."<br /><br />
Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas! This people has committed a great sin: they have made themselves gods of gold.<br /><br />
Oh, if only you would forgive their sin! Or else, blot me out of your book, the one you have written."<br /><br />
The Lord replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book."<br /><br />
"Go now, lead the people to the place I have indicated, and my angel will go before you. On the day I intervene, I will punish them for their sin."<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">106 (105):19-20, 21-22, 23.</font>@@@@@At Horeb they fashioned a calf,<br /><br />
they adored a metal object:<br /><br />
they exchanged what was their glory<br /><br />
for the image of a bull, a ruminant.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They forgot the God who saved them,<br /><br />
who had done wonders in Egypt,<br /><br />
miracles in the land of Ham,<br /><br />
terrifying deeds at the Red Sea.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
God decided to destroy them.<br /><br />
It was then that Moses, his chosen one,<br /><br />
stood in the breach before him,<br /><br />
to prevent his wrath from destroying them.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:31-35.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.<br /><br />
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is larger than other garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and make their nests in its branches."<br /><br />
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough had risen."<br /><br />
All this Jesus said to the crowds in parables, and he said nothing to them without a parable,<br /><br />
thus fulfilling what was spoken by the prophet: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.'<br />
