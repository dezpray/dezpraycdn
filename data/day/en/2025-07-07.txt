<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Purity of the faith</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
When the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth? let me remind them that the faith in question is that of which the Lord himself said, Matthew 9:22 Your faith has made you whole. And elsewhere, of the centurion, Matthew 8:10 I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And again, to the Apostles, Matthew 8:26 Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? In another place also, Matthew 17:20 If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove. For neither the centurion nor that poor woman who for twelve years was wasting away with a bloody flux, had believed in the mysteries of the Trinity, for these were revealed to the Apostles after the resurrection of Christ; so that the faith of such as believe in the mystery of the Trinity might have its due preeminence: but it was her singleness of mind and her devotion to her God that met with our Lord&#039;s approval: Matthew 9:21 For she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole. This is the faith which our Lord said was seldom found. This is the faith which even in the case of those who believe aright is hard to find in perfection. Matthew 9:29 According to your faith, be it done unto you, says God. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
I do not, indeed, like the sound of those words. For if it be done unto me according to my faith, I shall perish. And yet I certainly believe in God the Father, I believe in God the Son, and I believe in God the Holy Ghost. I believe in one God; nevertheless, I would not have it done unto me according to my faith. For the enemy often comes, and sows tares in the Lord&#039;s harvest....<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As it is, frequently in my prayers I am either walking in the arcades, or calculating my interest, or am carried away by base thoughts, so as to be occupied with things the mere mention of which makes me blush. I have given these illustrations that you may understand my meaning. But let every one commune with his own heart, and he will find throughout the whole of life how rare a thing it is to find a soul so faithful that it does nothing through the love of glory, nothing on account of the petty gossip of men... Vice is next-door neighbour to virtue. It is hard to rest content with God alone for judge.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">28,10-22a.</font>@@@@@Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and proceeded toward Haran.<br /><br />
When he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there for the night. Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep at that spot.<br /><br />
Then he had a dream: a stairway rested on the ground, with its top reaching to the heavens; and God&#039;s messengers were going up and down on it.<br /><br />
And there was the LORD standing beside him and saying: &quot;I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants.<br /><br />
These shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth, and through them you shall spread out east and west, north and south. In you and your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.<br /><br />
Know that I am with you; I will protect you wherever you go, and bring you back to this land. I will never leave you until I have done what I promised you.&quot;<br /><br />
When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed, &quot;Truly, the LORD is in this spot, although I did not know it!&quot;<br /><br />
In solemn wonder he cried out: &quot;How awesome is this shrine! This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven!&quot;<br /><br />
Early the next morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a memorial stone, and poured oil on top of it.<br /><br />
He called that site Bethel, whereas the former name of the town had been Luz.<br /><br />
Jacob then made this vow: &quot;If God remains with me, to protect me on this journey I am making and to give me enough bread to eat and clothing to wear,<br /><br />
and I come back safe to my father&#039;s house, the LORD shall be my God.<br /><br />
This stone that I have set up as a memorial stone shall be God&#039;s abode.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">91(90),1-2.3-4.14-15ab.</font>@@@@@You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High, <br /><br />
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,<br /><br />
Say to the LORD, &quot;My refuge and my fortress, <br /><br />
my God, in whom I trust.&quot;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For he will rescue you from the snare of the fowler, <br /><br />
from the destroying pestilence.<br /><br />
With his pinions he will cover you, <br /><br />
and under his wings you shall take refuge.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Because he clings to me, I will deliver him; <br /><br />
I will set him on high because he acknowledges my name.<br /><br />
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;<br /><br />
I will be with him in distress.  <br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9,18-26.</font>@@@@@While Jesus was speaking, an official came forward, knelt down before him, and said, &quot;My daughter has just died. But come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.<br /><br />
A woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel on his cloak.<br /><br />
She said to herself, &quot;If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus turned around and saw her, and said, &quot;Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you.&quot; And from that hour the woman was cured.<br /><br />
When Jesus arrived at the official&#039;s house and saw the flute players and the crowd who were making a commotion,<br /><br />
he said, &quot;Go away! The girl is not dead but sleeping.&quot; And they ridiculed him.<br /><br />
When the crowd was put out, he came and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.<br /><br />
And news of this spread throughout all that land.<br />
