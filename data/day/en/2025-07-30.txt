<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
While looking for your pearl<br /><br />
I never set myself as this merchant;<br /><br />
I have not, in exchange for the inexchangeable,<br /><br />
Given away the love of the ephemeral.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I have not sold, according to the commandment,<br /><br />
Earthly concupiscence,<br /><br />
In order to acquire that which is a higher price:<br /><br />
The morning star, born of dew.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O you who was born from the Virgin in the manner of the pearl,<br /><br />
God and man, the two forming only one,<br /><br />
Does all in your divine love<br /><br />
I am the beggar with wounded heart!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Open my nuptial chamber, I who longs;<br /><br />
Enter the apartment with the affection of the heart;<br /><br />
Give me your dwelling again<br /><br />
And kiss me at your right hand.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">34,29-35.</font>@@@@@As Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the commandments in his hands, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while he conversed with the LORD.<br /><br />
When Aaron, then, and the other Israelites saw Moses and noticed how radiant the skin of his face had become, they were afraid to come near him.<br /><br />
Only after Moses called to them did Aaron and all the rulers of the community come back to him. Moses then spoke to them.<br /><br />
Later on, all the Israelites came up to him, and he enjoined on them all that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.<br /><br />
When he finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.<br /><br />
Whenever Moses entered the presence of the LORD to converse with him, he removed the veil until he came out again. On coming out, he would tell the Israelites all that had been commanded.<br /><br />
Then the Israelites would see that the skin of Moses&#039; face was radiant; so he would again put the veil over his face until he went in to converse with the LORD.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">99(98),5.6.7.9.</font>@@@@@Extol the LORD, our God, <br /><br />
and worship at his footstool; <br /><br />
holy is he!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, <br /><br />
and Samuel, among those who called upon his name; <br /><br />
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From the pillar of cloud he spoke to them; <br /><br />
they heard his decrees and the law he gave them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Extol the LORD, our God, <br /><br />
and worship at his holy mountain; <br /><br />
for holy is the LORD, our God.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,44-46.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field, which a person finds and hides again, and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.<br /><br />
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.<br /><br />
When he finds a pearl of great price, he goes and sells all that he has and buys it&quot;.<br />
