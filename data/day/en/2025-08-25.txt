@@@@@Sing to the LORD a new song <br /><br />
of praise in the assembly of the faithful.<br /><br />
Let Israel be glad in their maker, <br /><br />
let the children of Zion rejoice in their king.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let them praise his name in the festive dance, <br /><br />
let them sing praise to him with timbrel and harp.<br /><br />
For the LORD loves his people, <br /><br />
and he adorns the lowly with victory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let the faithful exult in glory; <br /><br />
let them sing for joy upon their couches;<br /><br />
Let the high praises of God be in their throats.<br /><br />
This is the glory of all his faithful. Alleluia!<br />
