<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"He appointed twelve"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The Lord founded the Church by calling together the Twelve, who were to represent the future People of God. Faithful to the Lord&#039;s mandate, after his Ascension…, the Twelve continued to involve others in the duties entrusted to them so that they might continue their ministry. The Risen Lord himself called Paul (cf. Gal 1: 1)… This is the way in which this ministry, known from the second generation as the episcopal ministry, episcope, was to be continued… In this way, succession in the role of Bishop is presented as the continuity of the Apostolic ministry, a guarantee of the permanence of the Apostolic Tradition, word and life, entrusted to us by the Lord. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The link between the College of Bishops and the original community of the Apostles is understood above all in the line of historical continuity. As we have seen, first Matthias, then Paul, then Barnabas joined the Twelve, then others, until, in the second and third generations, the Bishop&#039;s ministry took shape… And in the continuity of the succession lies the guarantee of the permanence, in the Ecclesial Community, of the Apostolic College that Christ had gathered around him. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
This continuity, however, should also be understood in a spiritual sense, because Apostolic Succession in the ministry is considered a privileged place for the action and transmission of the Holy Spirit. We find these convictions clearly echoed in the following text, for example, by Irenaeus of Lyons:  &quot;It is within the power of all... in every Church, who may wish to see the truth, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the Apostles manifested throughout the whole world; and we are in a position to count those who were by the Apostles instituted Bishops in the Churches and... the succession of these men to our own times.... [The Apostles] were desirous that these men, whom also they were leaving behind as their successors, should be very perfect and blameless in all things, delivering up their own place of government to these men.&quot; <br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">41,55-57.42,5-7a.17-24a.</font>@@@@@When hunger came to be felt throughout the land of Egypt and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh directed all the Egyptians to go to Joseph and do whatever he told them.<br /><br />
When the famine had spread throughout the land, Joseph opened all the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians, since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
In fact, all the world came to Joseph to obtain rations of grain, for famine had gripped the whole world.<br /><br />
Thus, since there was famine in the land of Canaan also, the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations.<br /><br />
It was Joseph, as governor of the country, who dispensed the rations to all the people. When Joseph&#039;s brothers came and knelt down before him with their faces to the ground,<br /><br />
he recognized them as soon as he saw them. But he concealed his own identity from them and spoke sternly to them. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked them. They answered, &quot;From the land of Canaan, to procure food.&quot;<br /><br />
With that, he locked them up in the guardhouse for three days.<br /><br />
On the third day Joseph said to them: &quot;Do this, and you shall live; for I am a God-fearing man.<br /><br />
If you have been honest, only one of your brothers need be confined in this prison, while the rest of you may go and take home provisions for your starving families.<br /><br />
But you must come back to me with your youngest brother. Your words will thus be verified, and you will not die.&quot; To this they agreed.<br /><br />
To one another, however, they said: &quot;Alas, we are being punished because of our brother. We saw the anguish of his heart when he pleaded with us, yet we paid no heed; that is why this anguish has now come upon us.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Didn&#039;t I tell you,&quot; broke in Reuben, &quot;not to do wrong to the boy? But you wouldn&#039;t listen! Now comes the reckoning for his blood.&quot;<br /><br />
They did not know, of course, that Joseph understood what they said, since he spoke with them through an interpreter.<br /><br />
But turning away from them, he wept.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">33(32),2-3.10-11.18-19.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the LORD on the harp; <br /><br />
with the ten stringed lyre chant his praises.<br /><br />
Sing to him a new song; <br /><br />
pluck the strings skillfully, with shouts of gladness.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD brings to nought the plans of nations; <br /><br />
He foils the designs of peoples.<br /><br />
But the plan of the LORD stands forever; <br /><br />
The design of his heart, through all generations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him, <br /><br />
upon those who hope for his kindness,<br /><br />
To deliver them from death <br /><br />
and preserve them in spite of famine.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10,1-7.</font>@@@@@Jesus summoned his Twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness.<br /><br />
The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;<br /><br />
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus;<br /><br />
Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.<br /><br />
Jesus sent out these twelve after instructing them thus, &quot;Do not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town.<br /><br />
Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br /><br />
As you go, make this proclamation: &#039;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&#039;&quot;<br />
