<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The example of Saint Benedict: “Ora et labora – pray and work.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Saint Benedict knew how to interpret the signs of the time during his period in a clear-sighted and certain way when he wrote his rule, in which the union of prayer and work became, for those who accepted it, the principle of their aspiration towards eternity. “Ora et labora, pray and work.”… In reading the signs of the time, Benedict saw that it was necessary to implement the radical program of evangelical holiness… in an ordinary way, in the things that make up the daily life of every person. It was necessary to make “the heroic” normal, daily, and to make what was normal and daily life heroic. In that way, the father of monks, the legislator of monastic life in the West also became the pioneer of a new civilization. Everywhere, where human work conditioned the development of culture, of economy, of social life, he added the Benedictine program of evangelization, which united work to prayer and prayer to work…<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In our time, Saint Benedict is the patron of Europe. This is not only because of his particular merits as regards this continent, its history and civilization. It is also because of his person’s new timeliness as regards contemporary Europe. It is possible to detach work from prayer and to make it the only component of human existence. Our present-day period carries within it this tendency… One has the impression that the economy occupies first place, before a moral sense, that what is material has first place before what is spiritual. On the one hand, the almost exclusive orientation towards consumerism in material goods takes away the deepest meaning from human life. On the other hand, in many cases, work has become a force that alienates human beings … and almost in spite of himself, the person detaches himself from prayer, thus removing the transcendent dimension from human life…<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is not possible to live for the future without understanding that the meaning of life is greater than what is just material and passing, that the meaning of life goes beyond this world. If society and the people of our continent have lost interest in that meaning, they must find it again… If my predecessor Paul VI named Benedict of Nursia as patron of Europe, it was because this saint can help the Church and the nations of Europe with this.<br /><br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">46,1-7.28-30.</font>@@@@@Israel set out with all that was his. When he arrived at Beer-sheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.<br /><br />
There God, speaking to Israel in a vision by night, called, &quot;Jacob! Jacob!&quot; &quot;Here I am,&quot; he answered.<br /><br />
Then he said: &quot;I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.<br /><br />
Not only will I go down to Egypt with you; I will also bring you back here, after Joseph has closed your eyes.&quot;<br /><br />
So Jacob departed from Beer-sheba, and the sons of Israel put their father and their wives and children on the wagons that Pharaoh had sent for his transport.<br /><br />
They took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his descendants migrated to Egypt.<br /><br />
His sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters--all his descendants--he took with him to Egypt.<br /><br />
Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph, so that he might meet him in Goshen. On his arrival in the region of Goshen,<br /><br />
Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and rode to meet his father Israel in Goshen. As soon as he saw him, he flung himself on his neck and wept a long time in his arms.<br /><br />
And Israel said to Joseph, &quot;At last I can die, now that I have seen for myself that Joseph is still alive.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">37(36),3-4.18-19.27-28.39-40.</font>@@@@@Trust in the LORD and do good, <br /><br />
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.<br /><br />
Take delight in the LORD, <br /><br />
and he will grant you your heart&#039;s requests.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD watches over the lives of the wholehearted; <br /><br />
their inheritance lasts forever.<br /><br />
They are not put to shame in an evil time; <br /><br />
in days of famine they have plenty.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Turn from evil and do good, <br /><br />
that you may abide forever;<br /><br />
For the LORD loves what is right, <br /><br />
and forsakes not his faithful ones.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The salvation of the just is from the LORD; <br /><br />
He is their refuge in time of distress.<br /><br />
The LORD helps them and delivers them; <br /><br />
He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, <br /><br />
because they take refuge in him.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">10,16-23.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his Apostles: “Behold, I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves.<br /><br />
But beware of men, for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues,<br /><br />
and you will be led before governors and kings for my sake as a witness before them and the pagans.<br /><br />
When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say. You will be given at that moment what you are to say.<br /><br />
For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.<br /><br />
Brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.<br /><br />
You will be hated by all because of my name, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.&quot;<br /><br />
When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Amen, I say to you, you will not finish the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.&quot;<br />
