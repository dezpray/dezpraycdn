<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Christ will impose a reckoning on me</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
	Behold, I become passionately alarmed by what I have committed; I blush very much at what I have omitted; I become exceedingly frightened at the wastefulness of my life. I fear that future investigation at which Christ, a noble man, will impose a reckoning on me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	If he wanted to exact a deposit from me for my time and interest from the talent of understanding he conferred on me, I would, in short, not find any worthy answer for your charity. What will I do? Where will I turn? I lack the strength to dig; I should blush to beg. (Lk 16:3) O Loving-kindness. Loving-kindness. speak up now; may your dulcet counsel, I entreat you, warm my spirit back to life. Ah, answer me: what does it seem to you I should do in this [situation), for according to your name you have a truly loving and-kind heart and you know best what may be expedient for me in all this. Ah, pardon me and bring me help; and in this tribulation do not be detached from me. Let the poverty of my spirit move you and, touched by the compassion of your heart, say to me with loving-kindness: May there be one purse for me and you.&quot; (Prv 1:14)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	O Loving-kindness, Loving-kindness, you have stored up with yourself riches so immeasurable that heaven and earth do not suffice to contain them. You have driven my Jesus to give his soul for my soul, his life for mine, so that you might make everything that was his mine; and thus, out of your abundance, this pauper&#039;s substance might increase. Ah, call my starved soul to your food supply so that in this life I may live from your riches and, reared by you and nourished by you, may not grow faint under the discipline of the Lord until at length, under your guidance, I turn back to my God and give my spirit back to him who gave it. (Eccl 12:7)<br /><br />

First Letter to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">4,9-12.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: on the subject of fraternal charity you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.<br /><br />
Indeed, you do this for all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Nevertheless we urge you, brothers, to progress even more,<br /><br />
and to aspire to live a tranquil life, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your (own) hands, as we instructed you,<br /><br />
that you may conduct yourselves properly toward outsiders and not depend on anyone.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">98(97),1.7-8.9.</font>@@@@@Sing to the LORD a new song, <br /><br />
for he has done wondrous deeds; <br /><br />
His right hand has won victory for him, <br /><br />
his holy arm.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let the sea and what fills it resound,<br /><br />
the world and those who dwell in it;<br /><br />
Let the rivers clap their hands, <br /><br />
The mountains shout with them for joy before the LORD.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD comes, <br /><br />
He comes to rule the earth; <br /><br />
He will rule the world with justice <br /><br />
And the peoples with equity.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">25,14-30.</font>@@@@@Jesus told his disciples this parable: “A man going on a journey called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.<br /><br />
To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one– to each according to his ability. Then he went away. Immediately<br /><br />
the one who received five talents went and traded with them, and made another five.<br /><br />
Likewise, the one who received two made another two.<br /><br />
But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master&#039;s money.<br /><br />
After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.<br /><br />
The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five. He said, &#039;Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five more.&#039;<br /><br />
His master said to him, &#039;Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master&#039;s joy.&#039;<br /><br />
(Then) the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, &#039;Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more.&#039;<br /><br />
His master said to him, &#039;Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master&#039;s joy.&#039;<br /><br />
Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said, &#039;Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter;<br /><br />
so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground. Here it is back.&#039;<br /><br />
His master said to him in reply, &#039;You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter?<br /><br />
Should you not then have put my money in the bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?<br /><br />
Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.<br /><br />
For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br /><br />
And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.&#039;”<br />
