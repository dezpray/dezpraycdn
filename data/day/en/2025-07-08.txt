Holy Father, eternal source of existence and love,<br /><br />
who, in living man, show the splendour of your glory,<br /><br />
and who put in his heart the seed of your call,<br /><br />
let no-one, by reason of our negligence, ignore or lose this gift,<br /><br />
but may everyone walk, with wholehearted generosity,<br /><br />
towards the realisation of your Love.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lord Jesus, who in your pilgrimage along the roads of Palestine,<br /><br />
chose and called the apostles and entrusted to them their task<br /><br />
of preaching the Gospel, feeding the faithful and celebrating divine worship,<br /><br />
ensure that today, too, your Church may not lack<br /><br />
numerous holy priests, who can bring to all<br /><br />
the fruits of your death and resurrection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Holy Spirit, who sanctify the Church<br /><br />
with the constant pouring out of your gifts,<br /><br />
place into the hearts of those called to the consecrated life<br /><br />
a deep-rooted and resolute passion for the Kingdom,<br /><br />
so that with a generous and unconditioned &quot;yes&quot;,<br /><br />
they may place their entire existences at the service of the Gospel.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Most holy Virgin, who without hesitation<br /><br />
offered yourself to the Almighty<br /><br />
for the carrying out of his plan of salvation,<br /><br />
pour trust into the hearts of young people<br /><br />
so that there may always be zealous pastors<br /><br />
who are able to guide the Christian people on the way of life,<br /><br />
and consecrated souls who may know how to witness,<br /><br />
in chastity, poverty, and obedience,<br /><br />
to the freeing presence of your risen Son.<br /><br />
Amen.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">32,23-33.</font>@@@@@In the course of the night, Jacob arose, took his two wives, with the two maidservants and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.<br /><br />
After he had taken them across the stream and had brought over all his possessions,<br /><br />
Jacob was left there alone. Then some man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.<br /><br />
When the man saw that he could not prevail over him, he struck Jacob&#039;s hip at its socket, so that the hip socket was wrenched as they wrestled.<br /><br />
The man then said, &quot;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob said, &quot;I will not let you go until you bless me.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;What is your name?&quot; the man asked. He answered, &quot;Jacob.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the man said, &quot;You shall no longer be spoken of as Jacob, but as Israel, because you have contended with divine and human beings and have prevailed.&quot;<br /><br />
Jacob then asked him, &quot;Do tell me your name, please.&quot; He answered, &quot;Why should you want to know my name?&quot; With that, he bade him farewell.<br /><br />
Jacob named the place Peniel, &quot;Because I have seen God face to face,&quot; he said, &quot;yet my life has been spared.&quot;<br /><br />
At sunrise, as he left Penuel, Jacob limped along because of his hip.<br /><br />
That is why, to this day, the Israelites do not eat the sciatic muscle that is on the hip socket, inasmuch as Jacob&#039;s hip socket was struck at the sciatic muscle.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">17(16),1.2-3.6-7.8b.15.</font>@@@@@Hear, O LORD, a just suit;<br /><br />
attend to my outcry;<br /><br />
hearken to my prayer from lips without deceit.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From you let my judgment come; <br /><br />
Your eyes behold what is right.<br /><br />
Though you test my heart, searching it in the night, <br /><br />
though you try me with fire, you shall find no malice in me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;<br /><br />
incline your ear to me; hear my word.<br /><br />
Show your wondrous mercies, <br /><br />
O savior of those who flee from their foes<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hide me in the shadow of your wings.<br /><br />
I in justice shall behold your face;<br /><br />
on waking I shall be content in your presence.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9,32-38.</font>@@@@@A demoniac who could not speak was brought to Jesus,<br /><br />
and when the demon was driven out the mute person spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.&quot;<br /><br />
But the Pharisees said, &quot;He drives out demons by the prince of demons.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness.<br /><br />
At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd.<br /><br />
Then he said to his disciples, &quot;The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;<br /><br />
so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.&quot;<br />
