<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“He must increase, while I must decrease”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Before John the Baptist, we have seen many other great and saint prophets, worthy of God, filled with his Holy Spirit, who announced the coming of the Lord and who testified to the Truth. Nevertheless no one said of them what was said about John the Baptist: “among those born of women there has been none greater than John the Baptist” (Mt 11,11). So why was this greatness sent before the one who is greatness in itself? To bear witness to the Precursor&#039;s great humility.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He was so great that one could have easily taken him for the Messiah. Nothing easier...for, without saying anything, it is what those who listened to him and saw him believed...Nevertheless this humble friend of the groom, zealous in defending the honor of the groom, does not want to take the place of the groom, as an adulterer would do. He bears witness to his friend, he recommends to the bride the real groom and he absolutely does not want to be loved in his place because he wants to be loved only in him. “The best man, who stands and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom&#039;s voice” (Jn 3,29).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The disciple listens to his master; he stands because he listens, for if he refuses to listen he will certainly fall. What enhances to our eyes John&#039;s greatness is that he could have easily been taken for the Christ and nevertheless he preferred giving witness to Jesus Christ, proclaim his greatness and humble himself rather than to be considered the Messiah and deceive himself by deceiving the others. Therefore Jesus rightly so said of him that he was more than a prophet...John humbled himself before the greatness of the Lord so as to deserve that his humbleness be raised by this greatness...”I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals” (Mk 1,7).<br /><br />

Book of Isaiah <font dir="ltr">49,1-6.</font>@@@@@Hear me, O islands, listen, O distant peoples. The Lord called me from birth, from my mother&#039;s womb he gave me my name.<br /><br />
He made of me a sharp-edged sword and concealed me in the shadow of his arm. He made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me.<br /><br />
You are my servant, he said to me, Israel, through whom I show my glory.<br /><br />
Though I thought I had toiled in vain, and for nothing, uselessly, spent my strength, Yet my reward is with the LORD, my recompense is with my God.<br /><br />
For now the LORD has spoken who formed me as his servant from the womb, That Jacob may be brought back to him and Israel gathered to him; And I am made glorious in the sight of the LORD, and my God is now my strength!<br /><br />
It is too little, he says, for you to be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and restore the survivors of Israel; I will make you a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">139(138),1-3.13-14ab.14c-15.</font>@@@@@O LORD, you have probed me and you know me;<br /><br />
you know when I sit and when I stand; <br /><br />
you understand my thoughts from afar.<br /><br />
My journeys and my rest you scrutinize, <br /><br />
with all my ways you are familiar.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Truly you have formed my inmost being; <br /><br />
you knit me in my mother&#039;s womb.<br /><br />
I give you thanks that I am fearfully, wonderfully made;<br /><br />
wonderful are your works.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My soul also you knew full well;<br /><br />
nor was my frame unknown to you <br /><br />
when I was made in secret, <br /><br />
when I was fashioned in the depths of the earth.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">1,57-66.80.</font>@@@@@When the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son.<br /><br />
Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.<br /><br />
When they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father,<br /><br />
but his mother said in reply, &quot;No. He will be called John.&quot;<br /><br />
But they answered her, &quot;There is no one among your relatives who has this name.&quot;<br /><br />
So they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called.<br /><br />
He asked for a tablet and wrote, &quot;John is his name,&quot; and all were amazed.<br /><br />
Immediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God.<br /><br />
Then fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these matters were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea.<br /><br />
All who heard these things took them to heart, saying, &quot;What, then, will this child be?&quot; For surely the hand of the Lord was with him.<br /><br />
The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.<br />

Acts of the Apostles <font dir="ltr">13,22-26.</font>@@@@@In those days, Paul said: “God raised up David as king; of him God testified, I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will carry out my every wish.<br /><br />
From this man&#039;s descendants God, according to his promise, has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus.<br /><br />
John heralded his coming by proclaiming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel;<br /><br />
and as John was completing his course, he would say, &#039;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. Behold, one is coming after me; I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those others among you who are God-fearing, to us this word of salvation has been sent&quot;.<br />
