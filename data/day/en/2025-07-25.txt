<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“We are going up to Jerusalem ”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
“It is vain for you to rise early.” (Ps 127:2 – LXX Ps 126:2) What does that mean? … Christ, our Day, has risen. It is good for you to rise after Christ and not before him. Who are those who rise before Christ? … Those who want to be raised up here below, where he was humble. So may they be humble in this world, if they want to be raised up where Christ is raised up. For he said of those who adhered to him by faith – and we are among them: “Father, all those you gave me I would have in my company where I am.” (Jn 17:24) A magnificent gift, a great grace, a glorious promise… Do you want to be where he is raised up? Be humble where he was humble.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“No pupil outranks his teacher.” (Mt 10:24)… And yet, before undergoing humiliation in conformity with the Lord’s Passion, the sons of Zebedee had already chosen their places, one at his right side, the other at his left. They wanted to “rise early”. That is why they were walking in vain. The Lord called them back to humility by asking them: “Can you drink the chalice that I must drink? I came to be humble, and you want to be raised up before me? Follow me on the path where I am going, he said. For if you want to go by a path where I am not going, it is in vain.”<br />

Second Letter to the Corinthians <font dir="ltr">4,7-15.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: We hold this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us.<br /><br />
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained; perplexed, but not driven to despair;<br /><br />
persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;<br /><br />
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.<br /><br />
For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.<br /><br />
So death is at work in us, but life in you.<br /><br />
Since, then, we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, &quot;I believed, therefore I spoke,&quot; we too believe and therefore speak,<br /><br />
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence.<br /><br />
Everything indeed is for you, so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more people may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">126(125),1-2ab.2cd-3.4-5.6.</font>@@@@@When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion, <br /><br />
we were like men dreaming.<br /><br />
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br /><br />
and our tongue with rejoicing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then they said among the nations,<br /><br />
&quot;the LORD has done great things for them.&quot;<br /><br />
The LORD has done great things for us; <br /><br />
we are glad indeed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Restore our fortunes, O LORD, <br /><br />
like the torrents in the southern desert.<br /><br />
Those that sow in tears <br /><br />
shall reap rejoicing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Although they go forth weeping, <br /><br />
carrying the seed to be sown, <br /><br />
they shall come back rejoicing, <br /><br />
carrying their sheaves.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">20,20-28.</font>@@@@@The mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons and did him homage, wishing to ask him for something.<br /><br />
He said to her, &quot;What do you wish?&quot; She answered him, &quot;Command that these two sons of mine sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said in reply, &quot;You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?&quot; They said to him, &quot;We can.&quot;<br /><br />
He replied, &quot;My cup you will indeed drink, but to sit at my right and at my left, this is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.&quot;<br /><br />
When the ten heard this, they became indignant at the two brothers.<br /><br />
But Jesus summoned them and said, &quot;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt.<br /><br />
But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant;<br /><br />
whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.<br /><br />
Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;<br />
