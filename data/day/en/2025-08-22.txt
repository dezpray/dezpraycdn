Book of Ruth <font dir="ltr">1,1.3-6.14b-16.22.</font>@@@@@Once in the time of the judges there was a famine in the land; so a man from Bethlehem of Judah departed with his wife and two sons to reside on the plateau of Moab.<br /><br />
Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons,<br /><br />
who married Moabite women, one named Orpah, the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years,<br /><br />
both Mahlon and Chilion died also, and the woman was left with neither her two sons nor her husband.<br /><br />
She then made ready to go back from the plateau of Moab because word reached her there that the LORD had visited his people and given them food.<br /><br />
Again they sobbed aloud and wept; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye, but Ruth stayed with her.<br /><br />
&quot;See now!&quot; she said, &quot;your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her god. Go back after your sister-in-law!&quot;<br /><br />
But Ruth said, &quot;Do not ask me to abandon or forsake you! for wherever you go I will go, wherever you lodge I will lodge, your people shall be my people, and your God my God.<br /><br />
Thus it was that Naomi returned with the Moabite daughter-in-law, Ruth, who accompanied her back from the plateau of Moab. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">146(145),5-6.7.8-9a.9bc-10.</font>@@@@@Blessed he whose help is the God of Jacob, <br /><br />
whose hope is in the LORD, his God,<br /><br />
Who made heaven and earth, <br /><br />
the sea and all that is in them. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Who keeps faith forever,<br /><br />
secures justice for the oppressed, <br /><br />
gives food to the hungry. <br /><br />
The LORD sets captives free.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD gives sight to the blind. <br /><br />
The LORD raises up those who were bowed down; <br /><br />
the LORD loves the just.<br /><br />
The LORD protects strangers.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The fatherless and the widow the LORD sustains,<br /><br />
but the way of the wicked he thwarts.<br /><br />
The LORD shall reign forever; <br /><br />
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">22,34-40.</font>@@@@@When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together,<br /><br />
and one of them, a scholar of the law, tested him by asking,<br /><br />
“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”<br /><br />
He said to him, &quot;You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.<br /><br />
This is the greatest and the first commandment.<br /><br />
The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.<br /><br />
The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.&quot;<br />
