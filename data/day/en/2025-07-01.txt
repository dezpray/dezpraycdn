The Church – mystery of men’s union with God. It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery as the purpose of God’s plan: “to unite all things in him.” (Eph 1:10) St. Paul calls the nuptial union of Christ and the Church “a great mystery.” (Eph 5:32) Because she is united to Christ as to her bridegroom, she becomes a mystery in her turn. (Eph 5:32; 3:9-11; 5:25-27) Contemplating this mystery in her, Paul exclaims: “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Col 1:27)… <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mary goes before us all in the holiness that is the Church’s mystery as “the bride without spot or wrinkle.” (Eph 5:27) This is why the “Marian” dimension of the Church precedes the “Petrine.” (John Paul II) …<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of one Body, also implies the distinction of the two within a personal relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of bridegroom and bride. The theme of Christ as Bridegroom of the Church was prepared for by the prophets and announced by John the Baptist. (Jn 3:29) The Lord referred to himself as the “bridegroom.” (Mk 2:19) The Apostle speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful, members of his Body, as a bride “betrothed” to Christ the Lord so as to become but one spirit with him. (Mt 22:1-14; 25:1-13; 1 Cor 6:15-17; 2 Cor 11:2) The Church is the spotless bride of the spotless Lamb. (Rev 22:17; Eph 1:4; 5:27) “Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her.” (Eph 5:25-26) <br /><br />
<br /><br />
He has joined her with himself in an everlasting covenant and never stops caring for her as for his own body (Eph 5:29):&quot;This is the whole Christ, head and body, one formed from many… And the Lord himself says in the Gospel: &#039;So they are no longer two, but one flesh.&#039; (Mt 19:6) They are, in fact, two different persons, yet they are one in the conjugal union.&quot; (St. Augustine)<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">27,1-5.15-29.</font>@@@@@When Isaac was so old that his eyesight had failed him, he called his older son Esau and said to him, &quot;Son!&quot; &quot;Yes, father!&quot; he replied.<br /><br />
Isaac then said, &quot;As you can see, I am so old that I may now die at any time.<br /><br />
Take your gear, therefore--your quiver and bow--and go out into the country to hunt some game for me.<br /><br />
With your catch prepare an appetizing dish for me, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my special blessing before I die.&quot;<br /><br />
Rebekah had been listening while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. So when Esau went out into the country to hunt some game for his father,<br /><br />
Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau that she had in the house, and gave them to her younger son Jacob to wear;<br /><br />
and with the skins of the kids she covered up his hands and the hairless parts of his neck.<br /><br />
Then she handed her son Jacob the appetizing dish and the bread she had prepared.<br /><br />
Bringing them to his father, Jacob said, &quot;Father!&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; replied Isaac. &quot;Which of my sons are you?&quot;<br /><br />
Jacob answered his father: &quot;I am Esau, your first-born. I did as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your special blessing.&quot;<br /><br />
But Isaac asked, &quot;How did you succeed so quickly, son?&quot; He answered, &quot;The LORD, your God, let things turn out well with me.&quot;<br /><br />
Isaac then said to Jacob, &quot;Come closer, son, that I may feel you, to learn whether you really are my son Esau or not.&quot;<br /><br />
So Jacob moved up closer to his father. When Isaac felt him, he said, &quot;Although the voice is Jacob&#039;s, the hands are Esau&#039;s.&quot;<br /><br />
(He failed to identify him because his hands were hairy, like those of his brother Esau; so in the end he gave him his blessing.)<br /><br />
Again he asked him, &quot;Are you really my son Esau?&quot; &quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied.<br /><br />
Then Isaac said, &quot;Serve me your game, son, that I may eat of it and then give you my blessing.&quot; Jacob served it to him, and Isaac ate; he brought him wine, and he drank.<br /><br />
Finally his father Isaac said to him, &quot;Come closer, son, and kiss me.&quot;<br /><br />
As Jacob went up and kissed him, Isaac smelled the fragrance of his clothes. With that, he blessed him, saying, &quot;Ah, the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a field that the LORD has blessed!<br /><br />
&quot;May God give to you of the dew of the heavens And of the fertility of the earth abundance of grain and wine.<br /><br />
&quot;Let peoples serve you, and nations pay you homage; Be master of your brothers, and may your mother&#039;s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">135(134),1-2.3-4.5-6.</font>@@@@@Praise the name of the LORD; <br /><br />
Praise, you servants of the LORD<br /><br />
Who stand in the house of the LORD, <br /><br />
in the courts of the house of our God.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; <br /><br />
sing praise to his name, which we love;<br /><br />
For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, <br /><br />
Israel for his own possession.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For I know that the LORD is great; <br /><br />
our LORD is greater than all gods.<br /><br />
All that the LORD wills he does <br /><br />
in heaven and on earth, <br /><br />
in the seas and in all the deeps.  <br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">9,14-17.</font>@@@@@The disciples of John approached Jesus and said, &quot;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast?&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus answered them, &quot;Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.&quot;<br /><br />
No one patches an old cloak with a piece of unshrunken cloth, for its fullness pulls away from the cloak and the tear gets worse.<br /><br />
People do not put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the skins burst, the wine spills out, and the skins are ruined. Rather, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.&quot;<br />
