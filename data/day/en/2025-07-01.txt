<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"What sort of man is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey?" </font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The tradition of the Christians is no mere earthly discovery that was committed to them, nor is it a mortal idea that they think fit to guard so carefully, nor have they been entrusted with merely human secrets. But in reality the omnipotent, all-creating, invisible God from heaven introduced among men the truth and the holy and incomprehensible word and has established it in their hearts. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
He did not send, as one might imagine, some servant or angel or ruler, or one of those who manage things on earth, or one of those who have been entrusted with the administration of affairs in heaven (cf. Eph 1,21), but the “designer and creator” of the universe himself (Heb 11,10). It was by him that God created the heavens, by him he enclosed the sea in its own limits, whose secrets all the elements faithfully keep, from whom the sun has received the measures of the courses of the day to keep, whom the moon obeys when he commands her to shine at night, whom the stars obey, as they follow the course of the moon; by whom all things have been constituted and had their limits set and made subject, the heavens and the things in the heavens, the earth and the things on the earth, the sea and the things in the sea, fire, air, abyss, the things in the heights, the things in the deeps, the things between. It was he God sent to them. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Did he though do it as a man might suppose, like a tyrant with fear and terror? Not at all. But with gentleness and meekness, like a king sending his son, he sent him as king, he sent him as God, he sent him as man to men; he sent as seeking to save, as persuading, not compelling, for compulsion is not the way of God.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">19,15-29.</font>@@@@@As dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot on, saying, “On your way! Take with you your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.&quot;<br /><br />
When he hesitated, the men, by the LORD&#039;S mercy, seized his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters and led them to safety outside the city.<br /><br />
As soon as they had been brought outside, he was told: &quot;Flee for your life! Don&#039;t look back or stop anywhere on the Plain. Get off to the hills at once, or you will be swept away.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Oh, no, my lord!&quot; replied Lot.<br /><br />
&quot;You have already thought enough of your servant to do me the great kindness of intervening to save my life. But I cannot flee to the hills to keep the disaster from overtaking me, and so I shall die.<br /><br />
Look, this town ahead is near enough to escape to. It&#039;s only a small place. Let me flee there--it&#039;s a small place, isn&#039;t it?--that my life may be saved.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Well, then,&quot; he replied, &quot;I will also grant you the favor you now ask. I will not overthrow the town you speak of.<br /><br />
Hurry, escape there! I cannot do anything until you arrive there.&quot; That is why the town is called Zoar.<br /><br />
The sun was just rising over the earth as Lot arrived in Zoar;<br /><br />
at the same time the LORD rained down sulphurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah (from the LORD out of heaven).<br /><br />
He overthrew those cities and the whole Plain, together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil.<br /><br />
But Lot&#039;s wife looked back, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.<br /><br />
Early the next morning Abraham went to the place where he had stood in the LORD&#039;S presence.<br /><br />
As he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole region of the Plain, he saw dense smoke over the land rising like fumes from a furnace.<br /><br />
Thus it came to pass: when God destroyed the Cities of the Plain, he was mindful of Abraham by sending Lot away from the upheaval by which God overthrew the cities where Lot had been living.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">26(25),2-3.9-10.11-12.</font>@@@@@Search me, O LORD, and try me; <br /><br />
test my soul and my heart.<br /><br />
For your mercy is before my eyes, <br /><br />
and I walk in your truth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Gather not my soul with those of sinners, <br /><br />
nor with men of blood my life.<br /><br />
On their hands are crimes, <br /><br />
and their right hands are full of bribes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But I walk in integrity; <br /><br />
redeem me, and have mercy on me.<br /><br />
My foot stands on level ground; <br /><br />
in the assemblies I will bless the LORD.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8,23-27.</font>@@@@@As Jesus got into a boat, his disciples followed him.<br /><br />
Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by waves; but he was asleep.<br /><br />
They came and woke him, saying, &quot;Lord, save us! We are perishing!&quot;<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;Why are you terrified, O you of little faith?&quot; Then he got up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was great calm.<br /><br />
The men were amazed and said, &quot;What sort of man is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey?&quot;<br />
