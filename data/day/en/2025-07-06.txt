<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Man united to God penetrates the entire world</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Man, in the structure of the world, is, so to speak, in it&#039;s center. It has more power than other creatures that remain in the same structure, however. Because if he is small by his stature he is great in the energies of his soul. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The head lifted and feet well planted, it is able to move the elements from above like those from below. The works of his hands penetrate everything because he has, through the energy of the inner man, the possibility of implementing this power. The body is greater than the heart, but the energies of the soul are powerful in power of those of the body. The heart is hidden at the bottom of the body, but the body is surrounded by the energies of the soul that extend to the whole world. Thus, it is through the knowledge of God, consciousness united to God, that the faithful one exists, she tends to God in the constraints of the spirit of  this world. In all of it&#039;s businesses, prosperous or opposing, it is to God that he aspires. In them, he never ceases to show God all the love respect that animates him. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The soul contemplates from her eyes of flesh  the creatures that surround her, but by faith, it is God that she sees. She recognizes Him in all creatures because she perceives their creator.<br />

Book of Isaiah <font dir="ltr">66,10-14.</font>@@@@@Thus says the LORD: Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of her, all you who love her; Exult, exult with her, all you who were mourning over her!<br /><br />
Oh, that you may suck fully of the milk of her comfort, That you may nurse with delight at her abundant breasts!<br /><br />
For thus says the LORD: Lo, I will spread prosperity over her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing torrent. As nurslings, you shall be carried in her arms, and fondled in her lap;<br /><br />
As a mother comforts her son, so will I comfort you; in Jerusalem you shall find your comfort.<br /><br />
When you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bodies flourish like the grass; The LORD&#039;S power shall be known to his servants.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">66(65),1-3.4-5.6-7.16.20.</font>@@@@@Shout joyfully to God, all the earth,<br /><br />
sing praise to the glory of his name; <br /><br />
proclaim his glorious praise.<br /><br />
Say to God, “How tremendous are your deeds!”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“Let all on earth worship and sing praise to you, <br /><br />
sing praise to your name!”<br /><br />
Come and see the works of God, <br /><br />
his tremendous deeds among the children of Adam.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He has changed the sea into dry land; <br /><br />
through the river they passed on foot; <br /><br />
therefore let us rejoice in him.<br /><br />
He rules by his might forever.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hear now, all you who fear God, while I declare <br /><br />
what he has done for me.<br /><br />
Blessed be God who refused me not <br /><br />
my prayer or his kindness!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">10,1-12.17-20.</font>@@@@@The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit.<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.<br /><br />
Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.<br /><br />
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way.<br /><br />
Into whatever house you enter, first say, &#039;Peace to this household.&#039;<br /><br />
If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.<br /><br />
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another.<br /><br />
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you,<br /><br />
cure the sick in it and say to them, &#039;The kingdom of God is at hand for you.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
Whatever town you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets and say,<br /><br />
&#039;The dust of your town that clings to our feet, even that we shake off against you.&#039; Yet know this: the kingdom of God is at hand.<br /><br />
I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town.<br /><br />
The seventy (-two) returned rejoicing, and said, &quot;Lord, even the demons are subject to us because of your name.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said, &quot;I have observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky.<br /><br />
Behold, I have given you the power &#039;to tread upon serpents&#039; and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you.<br /><br />
Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.&quot;<br />

Letter to the Galatians <font dir="ltr">6,14-18.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<br /><br />
For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation.<br /><br />
Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule and to the Israel of God.<br /><br />
From now on, let no one make troubles for me; for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.<br /><br />
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.<br />
