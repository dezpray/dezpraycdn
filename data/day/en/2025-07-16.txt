The communion of life between Joseph and Jesus leads us to consider once again the mystery of the Incarnation, precisely in reference to the humanity of Jesus as the efficacious instrument of his divinity for the purpose of sanctifying man: &quot;By virtue of his divinity, Christ&#039;s human actions were salvific for us, causing grace within us, either by merit or by a certain efficacy.&quot;(St. Thomas of Aquino)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Among those actions, the gospel writers highlight those which have to do with the Paschal Mystery, but they also underscore the importance of physical contact with Jesus…The apostolic witness did not neglect the story of Jesus&#039; birth, his circumcision, his presentation in the Temple, his flight into Egypt and his hidden life in Nazareth. It recognized the &quot;mystery&quot; of grace present in each of these saving &quot;acts,&quot; in as much as they all share the same source of love: the divinity of Christ. If through Christ&#039;s humanity this love shone on all mankind, the first beneficiaries were undoubtedly those whom the divine will had most intimately associated with itself: Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Joseph, his presumed father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Why should the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph not have had an influence upon the &quot;filial&quot; love of Jesus? And vice versa why should the &quot;filial&quot; love of Jesus not have had an influence upon the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph, thus leading to a further deepening of their unique relationship? Those souls most sensitive to the impulses of divine love have rightly seen in Joseph a brilliant example of the interior life.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">23,1.4-11.15-16.27.34b-37.</font>@@@@@The LORD said to Moses,<br /><br />
&quot;These, then, are the festivals of the LORD which you shall celebrate at their proper time with a sacred assembly.<br /><br />
The Passover of the LORD falls on the fourteenth day of the first month, at the evening twilight.<br /><br />
The fifteenth day of this month is the LORD&#039;S feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br /><br />
On the first of these days you shall hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work.<br /><br />
On each of the seven days you shall offer an oblation to the LORD. Then on the seventh day you shall again hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work.&quot;<br /><br />
The LORD said to Moses,<br /><br />
&quot;Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you come into the land which I am giving you, and reap your harvest, you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest,<br /><br />
who shall wave the sheaf before the LORD that it may be acceptable for you. On the day after the sabbath the priest shall do this.<br /><br />
&quot;Beginning with the day after the sabbath, the day on which you bring the wave-offering sheaf, you shall count seven full weeks,<br /><br />
and then on the day after the seventh week, the fiftieth day, you shall present the new cereal offering to the LORD.<br /><br />
&quot;The tenth of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement, when you shall hold a sacred assembly and mortify yourselves and offer an oblation to the LORD.<br /><br />
&quot;Tell the Israelites: The fifteenth day of this seventh month is the LORD&#039;S feast of Booths, which shall continue for seven days.<br /><br />
On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly, and you shall do no sort of work.<br /><br />
For seven days you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, and on the eighth day you shall again hold a sacred assembly and offer an oblation to the LORD. On that solemn closing you shall do no sort of work.<br /><br />
&quot;These, therefore, are the festivals of the LORD on which you shall proclaim a sacred assembly, and offer as an oblation to the LORD holocausts and cereal offerings, sacrifices and libations, as prescribed for each day.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">81(80),3-4.5-6ab.10-11ab.</font>@@@@@Take up a melody, and sound the timbrel, <br /><br />
the pleasant harp and the lyre.<br /><br />
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, <br /><br />
at the full moon, on our solemn feast.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For it is a statute in Israel, <br /><br />
an ordinance of the God of Jacob,<br /><br />
Who made it a decree for Joseph<br /><br />
when he came forth from the land of Egypt.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
“There shall be no strange god among you <br /><br />
nor shall you worship any alien god.<br /><br />
I, the LORD, am your God<br /><br />
who led you forth from the land of Egypt.&quot;<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,54-58.</font>@@@@@Jesus came to his native place and taught the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said, &quot;Where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds?<br /><br />
Is he not the carpenter&#039;s son? Is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?<br /><br />
Are not his sisters all with us? Where did this man get all this?&quot;<br /><br />
And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, &quot;A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house.&quot;<br /><br />
And he did not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith.<br />
