Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">20,1-2.11-18.</font>@@@@@On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb.<br /><br />
So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, &quot;They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don&#039;t know where they put him.&quot;<br /><br />
But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb<br /><br />
and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.<br /><br />
And they said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping?&quot; She said to them, &quot;They have taken my Lord, and I don&#039;t know where they laid him.&quot;<br /><br />
When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was Jesus.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&quot; She thought it was the gardener and said to him, &quot;Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabbouni,&quot; which means Teacher.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, &#039;I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, &quot;I have seen the Lord,&quot; and what he told her.<br />
