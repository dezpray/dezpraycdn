<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">All of my holiness is in doing your will</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
O will of the Omnipotent God, <br /><br />
You are my delight,  You are my joy. <br /><br />
Whatever the hand of my Lord holds out to me <br /><br />
I will accept with gladness, submission and love. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your holy will is my repose; <br /><br />
In it is contained all my sanctity, <br /><br />
And all my eternal salvation, <br /><br />
For doing God’s will is the greatest glory. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The will of God - those are his various wishes <br /><br />
Which my soul carries out without reserve, <br /><br />
Because such are His divine desires, <br /><br />
In those moments when God shares His confidences with me. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Do with me as You will, Lord. <br /><br />
I place no obstacles, I make no reservations. <br /><br />
For You are my whole delight and the love of my soul, <br /><br />
And to You, in turn, I pour out the confidences of my heart. <br /><br />
<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">16,1-12.15-16.</font>@@@@@Abram&#039;s wife Sarai had borne him no children. She had, however, an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.<br /><br />
Sarai said to Abram: &quot;The LORD has kept me from bearing children. Have intercourse, then, with my maid; perhaps I shall have sons through her.&quot; Abram heeded Sarai&#039;s request.<br /><br />
Thus, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, his wife Sarai took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his concubine.<br /><br />
He had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. When she became aware of her pregnancy, she looked on her mistress with disdain.<br /><br />
So Sarai said to Abram: &quot;You are responsible for this outrage against me. I myself gave my maid to your embrace; but ever since she became aware of her pregnancy, she has been looking on me with disdain. May the LORD decide between you and me!&quot;<br /><br />
Abram told Sarai: &quot;Your maid is in your power. Do to her whatever you please.&quot; Sarai then abused her so much that Hagar ran away from her.<br /><br />
The LORD&#039;S messenger found her by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the road to Shur,<br /><br />
and he asked, &quot;Hagar, maid of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?&quot; She answered, &quot;I am running away from my mistress, Sarai.&quot;<br /><br />
But the LORD&#039;S messenger told her: &quot;Go back to your mistress and submit to her abusive treatment.<br /><br />
I will make your descendants so numerous,&quot; added the LORD&#039;S messenger, &quot;that they will be too many to count.<br /><br />
Besides,&quot; the LORD&#039;S messenger said to her: &quot;You are now pregnant and shall bear a son; you shall name him Ishmael, For the LORD has heard you, God has answered you.<br /><br />
He shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against everyone, and everyone&#039;s hand against him; In opposition to all his kin shall he encamp.&quot;<br /><br />
Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named the son whom Hagar bore him Ishmael.<br /><br />
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">106(105),1-2.3-4a.4b-5.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, <br /><br />
for his mercy endures forever.<br /><br />
Who can tell the mighty deeds of the LORD, <br /><br />
or proclaim all his praises?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are they who observe what is right, <br /><br />
who do always what is just.<br /><br />
Remember us, O LORD, as you favor your people.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Visit me with your saving help,<br /><br />
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, <br /><br />
rejoice in the joy of your people, <br /><br />
and glory with your inheritance.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">7,21-29.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;Not everyone who says to me, &#039;Lord, Lord,&#039; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.<br /><br />
Many will say to me on that day, &#039;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?&#039;<br /><br />
Then I will declare to them solemnly, &#039;I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.&#039;<br /><br />
Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.<br /><br />
The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock.<br /><br />
And everyone who listens to these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand.<br /><br />
The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. And it collapsed and was completely ruined.&quot;<br /><br />
When Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,<br /><br />
for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.<br />
