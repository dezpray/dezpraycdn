<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Liberation of Captives</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      On this day, Jesus Christ entered victoriously into the depths of hell. On this day, "he has broken the gates of bronze, and cut through the bars of iron," as Isaiah says (45:2). Note these expressions. He does not say that he "opened" the gates of bronze, nor that he removed them, but that he "broke" them, to make it understood that there is no longer a prison, to signify that Jesus annihilated this abode of captives. A prison where there are no longer any gates or bars can no longer hold prisoners. These gates that Christ broke, who could restore them? These bars that he severed, what man could put them back?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      When the princes of the earth release prisoners by sending letters of grace, they allow the prison gates and guards to remain, to show those who depart that they or others can still return. Christ does not act in this manner. By breaking the gates of bronze, he testifies that there is no longer captivity, no longer death.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Why gates "of bronze"?... Because death was merciless, unyielding, hard as diamond. Never, throughout all the centuries before Jesus Christ, had any of its captives been able to escape it, until the day when the Sovereign of heaven descended into the abyss to wrest its victims from it.<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">21:5, 8-20.</font>@@@@@Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.<br /><br />
The child grew, and he was weaned. Abraham gave a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.<br /><br />
Now, Sarah saw Ishmael, the son Abraham had by Hagar the Egyptian, playing.<br /><br />
She said to Abraham: "Cast out this servant woman and her son; for the son of this servant woman shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac."<br /><br />
This word greatly grieved Abraham, because of his son Ishmael,<br /><br />
but God said to him: "Do not be grieved because of the boy and your servant woman; listen to all that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named;<br /><br />
but I will also make a nation of the son of the servant woman, because he too is your offspring."<br /><br />
Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, and placed them on Hagar's shoulder; he gave her the child, then sent her away. She departed and went wandering in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br /><br />
When the water in the skin was exhausted, she left the child under a bush,<br /><br />
and went and sat down not far from there, at a distance of a bowshot. She said to herself: "I cannot bear to see the child die!" She sat down not far from there. She raised her voice and wept.<br /><br />
God heard the voice of the boy; and from heaven, the angel of God called to Hagar: "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy, under the bush where he was."<br /><br />
Arise! Take the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make of him a great nation."<br /><br />
Then, God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the skin and gave the boy a drink.<br /><br />
God was with him, and he grew; he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):7-8, 10-11, 12-13.</font>@@@@@A poor man cries; the Lord hears:<br /><br />
 he saves him from all his troubles.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps around <br /><br />
to deliver those who fear him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Saints of the Lord, worship him: <br /><br />
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.<br /><br />
The rich have lost everything, they hunger; <br /><br />
those who seek the Lord will lack no good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, my children, listen to me, <br /><br />
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.<br /><br />
Who among you loves life <br /><br />
and desires days when he will see happiness?<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">8:28-34.</font>@@@@@At that time, as Jesus arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the tombs to meet him; they were so aggressive that no one could pass by that way.<br /><br />
And behold, they cried out: "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?"<br /><br />
Now, there was a large herd of pigs in the distance, feeding.<br /><br />
The demons pleaded with Jesus: "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."<br /><br />
He said to them: "Go." They came out and went into the pigs; and behold, from the top of the cliff, the whole herd rushed down into the sea, and the pigs died in the waters.<br /><br />
The keepers fled and went into the city to report everything, and especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.<br /><br />
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their region.<br />
